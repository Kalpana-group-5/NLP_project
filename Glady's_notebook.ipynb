       "  'readme_contents': '\\nSpotify\\n=======\\n\\n[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/zmb3/spotify?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/zmb3/spotify)\\n\\nThis is a Go wrapper for working with Spotify\\'s\\n[Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).\\n\\nIt aims to support every task listed in the Web API Endpoint Reference,\\nlocated [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/).\\n\\nBy using this library you agree to Spotify\\'s\\n[Developer Terms of Use](https://developer.spotify.com/developer-terms-of-use/).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nTo install the library, simply\\n\\n`go get github.com/zmb3/spotify/v2`\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nSpotify uses OAuth2 for authentication and authorization.  \\nAs of May 29, 2017 _all_ Web API endpoints require an access token.\\n\\nYou can authenticate using a client credentials flow, but this does not provide\\nany authorization to access a user\\'s private data.  For most use cases, you\\'ll\\nwant to use the authorization code flow.  This package includes an `Authenticator`\\ntype to handle the details for you.\\n\\nStart by registering your application at the following page:\\n\\nhttps://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/.\\n\\nYou\\'ll get a __client ID__ and __secret key__ for your application.  An easy way to\\nprovide this data to your application is to set the SPOTIFY_ID and SPOTIFY_SECRET\\nenvironment variables.  If you choose not to use environment variables, you can\\nprovide this data manually.\\n\\n\\n````Go\\n// the redirect URL must be an exact match of a URL you\\'ve registered for your application\\n// scopes determine which permissions the user is prompted to authorize\\nauth := spotifyauth.New(spotifyauth.WithRedirectURL(redirectURL), spotifyauth.WithScopes(spotifyauth.ScopeUserReadPrivate))\\n\\n// get the user to this URL - how you do that is up to you\\n// you should specify a unique state string to identify the session\\nurl := auth.AuthURL(state)\\n\\n// the user will eventually be redirected back to your redirect URL\\n// typically you\\'ll have a handler set up like the following:\\nfunc redirectHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\\n      // use the same state string here that you used to generate the URL\\n      token, err := auth.Token(r.Context(), state, r)\\n      if err != nil {\\n            http.Error(w, \"Couldn\\'t get token\", http.StatusNotFound)\\n            return\\n      }\\n      // create a client using the specified token\\n      client := spotify.New(auth.Client(r.Context(), token))\\n\\n      // the client can now be used to make authenticated requests\\n}\\n````\\n\\nYou may find the following resources useful:\\n\\n1. Spotify\\'s Web API Authorization Guide:\\nhttps://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/\\n\\n2. Go\\'s OAuth2 package:\\nhttps://godoc.org/golang.org/x/oauth2/google\\n\\n\\n## Helpful Hints\\n\\n### Automatic Retries\\n\\nThe API will throttle your requests if you are sending them too rapidly.\\nThe client can be configured to wait and re-attempt the request.\\nTo enable this, set the `AutoRetry` field on the `Client` struct to `true`.\\n\\nFor more information, see Spotify [rate-limits](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/user-guide/#rate-limiting).\\n\\n## API Examples\\n\\nExamples of the API can be found in the [examples](examples) directory.\\n\\nYou may find tools such as [Spotify\\'s Web API Console](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/)\\nor [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/package/SpotifyPublicAPI/functions?utm_source=SpotifyGitHub&utm_medium=button&utm_content=Vendor_GitHub)\\nvaluable for experimenting with the API.\\n\\n### Missing data in responses\\n\\nIt\\'s extremely common that when there is no market information available in your\\nrequest, that the Spotify API will simply return null for details about a track\\nor episode.\\n\\nThis typically occurs when you are just using an application\\'s auth token, and\\naren\\'t impersonating a user via oauth. As when you are using a token associated\\nwith a user, the user\\'s market seems to be extracted from their profile and\\nused when producing the response.\\n'},\n",

If however you\\'re using an AUR helper you can install directly from that, for example (in the case of [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)), run\\n\\n```bash\\nyay -S spotify-tui\\n```\\n\\n### Nix\\n\\nAvailable as the package `spotify-tui`. To install run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnix-env -iA nixpkgs.spotify-tui\\n```\\n\\nWhere `nixpkgs` is the channel name in your configuration. For a more up-to-date installation, use the unstable channel.\\nIt is also possible to add the package to `environment.systemPackages` (for NixOS), or `home.packages` when using [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager).\\n\\n### Void Linux\\n\\nAvailable on the official repositories. To install, run\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo xbps-install -Su spotify-tui\\n```\\n\\n### Fedora/CentOS\\n\\nAvailable on the [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/spotify-tui/) repositories. To install, run\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo dnf copr enable atim/spotify-tui -y && sudo dnf install spotify-tui\\n```\\n\\n### Cargo\\n\\nUse this option if your architecture is not supported by the pre-built binaries found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases).\\n\\nFirst, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo install spotify-tui\\n```\\n\\nThis method will build the binary from source.\\n\\nTo update, run the same command again.\\n\\n#### Note on Linux\\n\\nFor compilation on Linux the development packages for `libssl` are required.\\nFor basic installation instructions, see [install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic).\\nIn order to locate dependencies, the compilation also requires `pkg-config` to be installed.\\n\\nIf you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you\\'ll need to [install additional dependencies](#windows-subsystem-for-linux).\\n\\n### Windows 10\\n\\n#### Scoop installer\\n\\nFirst, make sure scoop installer is on your windows box, for instruction please visit [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)\\n\\nThen open powershell and run following two commands:\\n\\n```bash\\nscoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/Rigellute/scoop-bucket\\nscoop install spotify-tui\\n```\\n\\nAfter that program is available as: `spt` or `spt.exe`\\n\\n### Manual\\n\\n1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases) for your OS.\\n1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and unzip\\n1. `cd` to `spotify-tui` and run with `./spt`\\n\\n## Connecting to Spotify’s API\\n\\n`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by\\nname, play tracks etc.\\n\\nInstructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.\\n\\nBut here they are again:\\n\\n1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)\\n1. Click `Create an app`\\n    - You now can see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`\\n1. Now click `Edit Settings`\\n1. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs\\n1. Scroll down and click `Save`\\n1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!\\n1. Go back to the terminal\\n1. Run `spt`\\n1. Enter your `Client ID`\\n1. Enter your `Client Secret`\\n1. Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port\\n1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.\\n1. After accepting the permissions, you\\'ll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you\\'re done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you\\'ll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like \"Connection Refused\" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.\\n\\nAnd now you are ready to use the `spotify-tui` 🎉\\n\\nYou can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`. (for snap `${HOME}/snap/spt/current/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`)\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe binary is named `spt`.\\n\\nRunning `spt` with no arguments will bring up the UI. Press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.\\nThere is also a CLI that is able to do most of the stuff the UI does. Use `spt --help` to learn more.\\n\\nHere are some example to get you excited.\\n```\\nspt --completions zsh # Prints shell completions for zsh to stdout (bash, power-shell and more are supported)\\n\\nspt play --name \"Your Playlist\" --playlist --random # Plays a random song from \"Your Playlist\"\\nspt play --name \"A cool song\" --track # Plays \\'A cool song\\'\\n\\nspt playback --like --shuffle # Likes the current song and toggles shuffle mode\\nspt playback --toggle # Plays/pauses the current playback\\n\\nspt list --liked --limit 50 # See your liked songs (50 is the max limit)\\n\\n# Looks for \\'An even cooler song\\' and gives you the \\'{name} from {album}\\' of up to 30 matches\\nspt search \"An even cooler song\" --tracks --format \"%t from %b\" --limit 30\\n```\\n\\n# Configuration\\n\\nA configuration file is located at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`, for snap `${HOME}/snap/spt/current/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`\\n(not to be confused with client.yml which handles spotify authentication)\\n\\nThe following is a sample config.yml file:\\n\\n```yaml\\n# Sample config file\\n\\n# The theme colours can be an rgb string of the form \"255, 255, 255\" or a string that references the colours from your terminal theme: Reset, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Gray, DarkGray, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow, LightBlue, LightMagenta, LightCyan, White.\\ntheme:\\n  active: Cyan # current playing song in list\\n  banner: LightCyan # the \"spotify-tui\" banner on launch\\n  error_border: Red # error dialog border\\n  error_text: LightRed # error message text (e.g. \"Spotify API reported error 404\")\\n  hint: Yellow # hint text in errors\\n  hovered: Magenta # hovered pane border\\n  inactive: Gray # borders of inactive panes\\n  playbar_background: Black # background of progress bar\\n  playbar_progress: LightCyan # filled-in part of the progress bar\\n  playbar_progress_text: Cyan # song length and time played/left indicator in the progress bar\\n  playbar_text: White # artist name in player pane\\n  selected: LightCyan # a) selected pane border, b) hovered item in list, & c) track title in player\\n  text: \"255, 255, 255\" # text in panes\\n  header: White # header text in panes (e.g. \\'Title\\', \\'Artist\\', etc.)\\n\\nbehavior:\\n  seek_milliseconds: 5000\\n  volume_increment: 10\\n  # The lower the number the higher the \"frames per second\".

So you\\'ll need either an official Spotify client open or a lighter weight alternative such as [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).\\n\\nIf you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.\\n\\n## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)\\n\\nFollow the spotifyd documentation to get set up.\\n\\nAfter that there is not much to it.\\n\\n1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.\\n1. Start up `spt`\\n1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd \"device\" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)\\n\\n## Libraries used\\n\\n- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)\\n- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)\\n1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\\n1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)\\n1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it\\n1. And then `cargo run`\\n\\n### Windows Subsystem for Linux\\n\\nYou might get a linking error. If so, you\\'ll probably need to install additional dependencies required by the clipboard package\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt-get install -y -qq pkg-config libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev\\n```\\n\\n## Contributors\\n\\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\\n\\n<!--

It enables applications to use Spotify\\'s service to control and play music via various backends, and to act as a Spotify Connect receiver. It is an alternative to the official and [now deprecated](https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/#libspotify-s-deprecation) closed-source `libspotify`. Additionally, it will provide extra features which are not available in the official library.\\n\\n_Note: librespot only works with Spotify Premium. This will remain the case. We will not support any features to make librespot compatible with free accounts, such as limited skips and adverts._\\n\\n## Quick start\\nWe\\'re available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/librespot) as the _librespot_ package. Simply run `cargo install librespot` to install librespot on your system. Check the wiki for more info and possible [usage options](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).\\n\\nAfter installation, you can run librespot from the CLI using a command such as `librespot -n \"Librespot Speaker\" -b 160` to create a speaker called _Librespot Speaker_ serving 160 kbps audio.\\n\\n## This fork\\nAs the origin by [plietar](https://github.com/plietar/) is no longer actively maintained, this organisation and repository have been set up so that the project may be maintained and upgraded in the future.\\n\\n# Documentation\\nDocumentation is currently a work in progress, contributions are welcome!\\n\\nThere is some brief documentation on how the protocol works in the [docs](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/tree/master/docs) folder.\\n\\n[COMPILING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md) contains detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, and compiling librespot. More general usage and compilation information is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki).\\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) also contains our contributing guidelines.\\n\\nIf you wish to learn more about how librespot works overall, the best way is to simply read the code, and ask any questions you have in our [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources).\\n\\n# Issues & Discussions\\n**We have recently started using Github discussions for general questions and feature requests, as they are a more natural medium for such cases, and allow for upvoting to prioritize feature development. Check them out [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/discussions). Bugs and issues with the underlying library should still be reported as issues.**\\n\\nIf you run into a bug when using librespot, please search the existing issues before opening a new one. Chances are, we\\'ve encountered it before, and have provided a resolution. If not, please open a new one, and where possible, include the backtrace librespot generates on crashing, along with anything we can use to reproduce the issue, e.g. the Spotify URI of the song that caused the crash.\\n\\n# Building\\nA quick walkthrough of the build process is outlined below, while a detailed compilation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md).\\n\\n## Additional Dependencies\\nWe recently switched to using [Rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) for audio playback by default, hence for macOS and Windows, you should just be able to clone and build librespot (with the command below).\\nFor Linux, you will need to run the additional commands below, depending on your distro.\\n\\nOn Debian/Ubuntu, the following command will install these dependencies:\\n```shell\\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev\\n```\\n\\nOn Fedora systems, the following command will install these dependencies:\\n```shell\\nsudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel make gcc\\n```\\n\\nlibrespot currently offers the following selection of [audio backends](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends):\\n```\\nRodio (default)\\nALSA\\nGStreamer\\nPortAudio\\nPulseAudio\\nJACK\\nJACK over Rodio\\nSDL\\nPipe\\nSubprocess\\n```\\nPlease check the corresponding [Compiling](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies) entry on the wiki for backend specific dependencies.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve installed the dependencies and cloned this repository you can build *librespot* with the default backend using Cargo.\\n```shell\\ncargo build --release\\n```\\n\\n# Packages\\n\\nlibrespot is also available via official package system on various operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD. [Repology](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions) offers a good overview.\\n\\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/librespot.svg)](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions)\\n\\n## Usage\\nA sample program implementing a headless Spotify Connect receiver is provided.\\nOnce you\\'ve built *librespot*, run it using :\\n```shell\\ntarget/release/librespot --name DEVICENAME\\n```\\n\\nThe above is a minimal example. Here is a more fully fledged one:\\n```shell\\ntarget/release/librespot -n \"Librespot\" -b 320 -c ./cache --enable-volume-normalisation --initial-volume 75 --device-type avr\\n```\\nThe above command will create a receiver named ```Librespot```, with bitrate set to 320 kbps, initial volume at 75%, with volume normalisation enabled, and the device displayed in the app as an Audio/Video Receiver. A folder named ```cache``` will be created/used in the current directory, and be used to cache audio data and credentials.\\n\\nA full list of runtime options is available [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).\\n\\n_Please Note: When using the cache feature, an authentication blob is stored for your account in the cache directory. For security purposes, we recommend that you set directory permissions on the cache directory to `700`._\\n\\n## Contact\\nCome and hang out on gitter if you need help or want to offer some:\\nhttps://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\nUsing this code to connect to Spotify\\'s API is probably forbidden by them.\\nUse at your own risk.\\n\\n## License\\nEverything in this repository is licensed under the MIT license.\\n\\n## Related Projects\\nThis is a non exhaustive list of projects that either use or have modified librespot.

Also, we\\'ll be able to play a preview of some of these songs.\\n\\n<!-- To see the final product check out the deployed version: https://spotify-lab.herokuapp.com. -->\\n\\nIt may seem like a lot, but let\\'s break it down into steps!\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\n- Fork this repo\\n- Clone this repo\\n\\n## Submission\\n\\n- Upon completion, run the following commands:\\n\\n```\\n$ git add .\\n$ git commit -m \"done\"\\n$ git push origin master\\n```\\n\\n- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.\\n\\n## The key helper: `spotify-web-api-node` npm package\\n\\nSpotify is great for streaming music from the app, but they also have a [Web Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) for us developers to play with.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this exercise, we will be using the [`spotify-web-api-node` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node) (this is the link that will take you to the documentation so go ahead and open it). As we can find in the docs, this package gives us simple methods to make requests to Spotify, and give us back artists, albums, tracks, and more.\\n\\n**In this lab, we have two main goals**:\\n\\n- We are going to apply our knowledge of GET method and when and why to use `req.query` and `req.params`.\\n- We are going to practice how to **read the documentation** (of this npm package particularly) and how to use the examples provided by the docs to successfully finish all the iterations.\\n\\n### Registering the app and getting the credentials\\n\\nThe **Spotify** API will need a `clientId` and `clientSecret` in order to give us permission to make requests and get some data back. To get `clientId` and `clientSecret`, we have to register our app on the official Spotify Developers web site (you won\\'t be charged for this, and no credit card information will be required). Let\\'s follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Navigate to [Spotify Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/).\\n2. Click on the \"Log In\" button. If you do not have an account, you will be asked to create one, it´s free :wink:.\\n3. After logging in, click on the **Create an App** button.\\n\\nThe following screens might be out of date, since Spotify is constantly iterating on their interface, but that shouldn\\'t stop you from completing these steps. You got this!\\n\\n<!-- ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_a3a19d215083c5526df1f53f3c1fdf6f.png) -->\\n\\n4. Fill the fields and submit the form.\\n\\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_db933b4f08d71ceff0b0d5d4ca124594.png)\\n\\n5. We are ready to go! We have all the info we need :muscle: Let´s start!\\n\\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_8859d022ca1d53adc9f9ec829ec3d17b.png)\\n\\n## Iteration 1 | Spotify API Setup\\n\\nIn the next few steps, you\\'ll create all of the files that you need. So far, you have some basic setup in `app.js`, but that\\'s not quite enough. As you remember, to get some packages (including `express`) in our app, we have to have them in the `package.json` file. So let\\'s start listing the steps:\\n\\n1. Let\\'s install all the dependencies we need to successfully run this app:\\n   `npm install express hbs spotify-web-api-node dotenv`.\\n2. `nodemon` is installed as a dev dependency (our app doesn\\'t depend on it but it helps us in the development process), which means we can use nodemon to run the app with: **`npm run dev`**.\\n\\n3. Inside of the `app.js` file, require `spotify-web-api-node`.\\n\\n```js\\nconst SpotifyWebApi = require(\\'spotify-web-api-node\\');\\n```\\n\\n4. Inside of the `app.js` file, you\\'ll find the place where you should paste the following code:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,\\n  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET\\n});\\n\\n// Retrieve an access token\\nspotifyApi\\n  .clientCredentialsGrant()\\n  .then(data => spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\'access_token\\']))\\n  .catch(error => console.log(\\'Something went wrong when retrieving an access token\\', error));\\n```\\n\\n5. See this above?\\n\\n```js\\nconst spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,\\n  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET\\n});\\n```\\n\\nTo avoid making our API keys public, we don\\'t want to add and commit them. We\\'ll use a package named `dotenv` for that.\\n\\nThis package is imported at the very beginning of `app.js`. All that is left to do is to add your keys in the `.env` file.\\nSo go ahead and create a `.env` file and paste the following lines there, replacing the text with your credentials.\\n\\n```\\nCLIENT_ID=your clientId goes here\\nCLIENT_SECRET=your clientSecret goes here\\n```\\n\\n:zap: The `.env` is referred to in the `.gitignore` file so you\\'re safe!\\n\\n:fire: _Styling should be the last thing you focus on. Functionality first!_ 🙏🏻\\n\\n## Iteration 2 | Express Setup\\n\\nNow let\\'s create a `views` folder and let\\'s add the `layout.hbs` file in it.\\nAt this moment we should have the following structure of folders and files:\\n\\n```\\nlab-express-spotify\\n      ├── app.js\\n      ├── package.json\\n      ├── package-lock.json\\n      ├── public\\n      │\\xa0\\xa0  ├── images\\n      │\\xa0\\xa0  └── stylesheets\\n      │\\xa0\\xa0       └── style.css\\n      └── views\\n            └── layout.hbs\\n```\\n\\nAs we can see, in your _app.js_ we have required all the packages we need for now:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require(\\'express\\');\\nconst hbs = require(\\'hbs\\');\\nconst SpotifyWebApi = require(\\'spotify-web-api-node\\');\\n```\\n\\nWe are good to go. Let\\'s open the [spotify-web-api-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node) documentation and start our journey!\\n\\n## Iteration 3 | Search for an Artist\\n\\n**You can keep all your routes in the `app.js` after where it states: _// Our routes go here:_.**\\n\\n### Step 1 | Create a Homepage\\n\\nCreate a route that renders a simple home page. You\\'ll need a basic index route, that renders a home page. On this page, you should have a small search `form` that has an input field receiving an artist\\'s name and a button that submits the request.\\n\\nThis form should direct its query to `/artist-search` (`action=\"/artist-search\", method=\"GET\"`).\\nThe result should be something along these lines but leave styling for the end.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YuTA0vQ.png=400x)\\n\\n### Step 2 | Display results for artist search\\n\\nOkay, our search form submitted to `/artist-search` route. We still don\\'t have this route created so let\\'s do it!\\nThis route will receive the search term from the `query` string, and make a search request using one of the methods of the Spotify npm package. You have the documentation open :wink: but we will help you with your first step.\\n\\nThe method we will use from the npm package is: `spotifyApi.searchArtists()`. In this route, you should have something like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nspotifyApi\\n  .searchArtists(/*\\'HERE GOES THE QUERY ARTIST\\'*/)\\n  .then(data => {\\n    console.log(\\'The received data from the API: \\', data.body);\\n    // ----> \\'HERE WHAT WE WANT TO DO AFTER RECEIVING THE DATA FROM THE API\\'\\n  })\\n  .catch(err => console.log(\\'The error while searching artists occurred: \\', err));\\n```\\n\\nIn order to display the found artists\\' information, create `artist-search-results.hbs` file inside `views` folder and display name, image, and button (or link) to show the albums for a particular artist on a new view (for now just create the button/link and we will take care of the rest in the next step). Again, styling is not your priority, so let\\'s move to the next step.\\n<br><br>\\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_9dc721e76158df1836ef07565b5385c2.png)\\n\\n## Iteration 4 | View Albums\\n\\nOn the `artist-search-results.hbs` page we created the `View albums` button/link. Users should be taken to _some other page_ after clicking on it and there be able to see all the albums of that particular artist. **Hint**: the URL should include artist\\'s `id` 🤓 and should change dynamically.\\n\\n```html\\n<a href=\"/albums/someArtistIdGoesHere\">View Albums</a>\\n```\\n\\nSo let\\'s create a new page - `albums.hbs` where all the results will be displayed. Make sure you show the _name_ and the _cover_ of each album and add a button/link to see the tracks (next iteration).\\n\\n:zap: Check out the `.getArtistAlbums()` method in the [spotify-web-api-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node) documentation.\\n\\n**Hint**:\\n\\nYour route should look like the following:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.get(\\'/albums/:artistId\\', (req, res, next) => {\\n  // .getArtistAlbums() code goes here\\n});\\n```\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oaoqQMj.png)\\n\\nThis is going good so far, so let\\'s finish up with our last iteration.\\n\\n## Iteration 5 | View Tracks\\n\\nCreate the `View tracks` link on the albums page. This link should take you to a page with a list of all of the tracks on a particular album.\\n\\n**Hint**: The link to the tracks page should have each album\\'s _id_ in it. <br>\\n**Note**: :zap: Check out the `.getAlbumTracks()` method in the `spotify-web-api-node` documentation.\\n\\nA track object comes with a `preview_url`, which is the source for a 30-second preview of a particular song. You can plug this into an HTML [`audio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) tag, and it will play the preview.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XVKoeqg.png)\\n\\n### The summary of requirements\\n\\n- Total of five pages with (1)artist / (2)album / (3)track information (all populated from Spotify) + (4)layout + (5)home.\\n- Some styling, it doesn\\'t have to look like the example.\\n\\nHappy Coding! 💙\\n'},\n",

Handling credentials is described in detail in the Authorization section.\\n\\n```javascript\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\'<your_access_token>\\');\\n```\\n\\nLastly, use the wrapper\\'s helper methods to make the request to Spotify\\'s Web API. The wrapper uses promises, so you need to provide a success callback as well as an error callback.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Get Elvis\\' albums\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\').then(\\n  function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Artist albums\\', data.body);\\n  },\\n  function(err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIf you dont wan\\'t to use promises, you can provide a callback method instead.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Get Elvis\\' albums\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\n  \\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\',\\n  { limit: 10, offset: 20 },\\n  function(err, data) {\\n    if (err) {\\n      console.error(\\'Something went wrong!\\');\\n    } else {\\n      console.log(data.body);\\n    }\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThe functions that fetch data from the API also accept a JSON object with a set of options. For example, `limit` and `offset` can be used in functions that returns paginated results, such as search and retrieving an artist\\'s albums.\\n\\nNote that the **options** parameter is **required if you\\'re using a callback method.**, even if it\\'s empty.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Passing a callback - get Elvis\\' albums in range [20...29]\\nspotifyApi\\n  .getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\', { limit: 10, offset: 20 })\\n  .then(\\n    function(data) {\\n      console.log(\\'Album information\\', data.body);\\n    },\\n    function(err) {\\n      console.error(err);\\n    }\\n  );\\n```\\n\\n### Responses and errors\\n\\nThis exposes the response headers, status code and body. \\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"body\" : {\\n\\n  },\\n  \"headers\" : {\\n\\n  },\\n  \"statusCode\" :\\n}\\n```\\n\\nErrors have same fields, as well as a human readable `message`. This is especially useful since \\nSpotify\\'s Web API returns different types of error objects depending on the endpoint being called.\\n\\n#### Example of a response\\n\\nRetrieving a track\\'s metadata in `spotify-web-api-node` version 1.4.0 and later:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"body\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Golpe Maestro\",\\n    \"popularity\": 42,\\n    \"preview_url\":\\n      \"https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/4ac44a56e3a4b7b354c1273d7550bbad38c51f5d\",\\n    \"track_number\": 1,\\n    \"type\": \"track\",\\n    \"uri\": \"spotify:track:3Qm86XLflmIXVm1wcwkgDK\"\\n  },\\n  \"headers\": {\\n    \"date\": \"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 09:25:48 GMT\",\\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json; charset=utf-8\",\\n    \"cache-control\": \"public, max-age=7200\"\\n  },\\n  \"statusCode\": 200\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### More examples\\n\\nBelow are examples for all helper functions. Longer examples of some requests can be found in the [examples folder](examples/). \\n\\n```javascript\\nvar SpotifyWebApi = require(\\'spotify-web-api-node\\');\\n\\nvar spotifyApi = new

Authorization\\nSupplying an access token is required for all requests to the Spotify API. This wrapper supports three authorization flows - The Authorization Code flow (signed by a user), the Client Credentials flow (application authentication - the user isn\\'t involved), and the Implicit Grant Flow (For completely clientside applications). See Spotify\\'s [Authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-web-api/authorization-guide/) for detailed information on these flows.\\n\\n**Important: If you are writing a universal/isomorphic web app using this library, you will not be able to use  methods that send a client secret to the Spotify authorization service. Client secrets should be kept server-side and not exposed to client browsers. Never include your client secret in the public JS served to the browser.**\\n\\nThe first thing you need to do is to [create an application](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/). A step-by-step tutorial is offered by Spotify in this [tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-web-api/tutorial/).\\n\\n#### Authorization code flow\\n\\nWith the application created and its redirect URI set, the only thing necessary for the application to retrieve an **authorization code** is the user\\'s permission. Which permissions you\\'re able to ask for is documented in Spotify\\'s [Using Scopes section](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-web-api/using-scopes/).\\n\\nIn order to get permissions, you need to direct the user to [Spotify\\'s Accounts service](https://accounts.spotify.com). Generate the URL by using the wrapper\\'s authorization URL method.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar scopes = [\\'user-read-private\\', \\'user-read-email\\'],\\n  redirectUri = \\'https://example.com/callback\\',\\n  clientId = \\'5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165\\',\\n  state = \\'some-state-of-my-choice\\';\\n\\n// Setting credentials can be done in the wrapper\\'s constructor, or using the API object\\'s setters.\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  redirectUri: redirectUri,\\n  clientId: clientId\\n});\\n\\n// Create the authorization URL\\nvar authorizeURL = spotifyApi.createAuthorizeURL(scopes, state);\\n\\n// https://accounts.spotify.com:443/authorize?client_id=5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&state=some-state-of-my-choice\\nconsole.log(authorizeURL);\\n```\\n\\nThe example below uses a hardcoded authorization code, retrieved from the Accounts service as described above.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar credentials = {\\n  clientId: \\'someClientId\\',\\n  clientSecret: \\'someClientSecret\\',\\n  redirectUri: \\'http://www.michaelthelin.se/test-callback\\'\\n};\\n\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi(credentials);\\n\\n// The code that\\'s returned as a query parameter to the redirect URI\\nvar code = \\'MQCbtKe23z7YzzS44KzZzZgjQa621hgSzHN\\';\\n\\n// Retrieve an access token and a refresh token\\nspotifyApi.authorizationCodeGrant(code).then(\\n  function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'The token expires in \\' + data.body[\\'expires_in\\']);\\n    console.log(\\'The access token is \\' + data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n    console.log(\\'The refresh token is \\' + data.body[\\'refresh_token\\']);\\n\\n    // Set the access token on the API object to use it in later calls\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n    spotifyApi.setRefreshToken(data.body[\\'refresh_token\\']);\\n  },\\n  function(err) {\\n    console.log(\\'Something went wrong!\\', err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\nSince the access token was set on the API object in the previous success callback, **it\\'s going to be used in future calls**. As it was retrieved using the Authorization Code flow, it can also be refreshed.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// clientId, clientSecret and refreshToken has been set on the api object previous to this call.\\nspotifyApi.refreshAccessToken().then(\\n  function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'The access token has been refreshed!\\');\\n\\n    // Save the access token so that it\\'s used in future calls\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n  },\\n  function(err) {\\n    console.log(\\'Could not refresh access token\\', err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n#### Client Credential flow\\n\\nThe Client Credential flow doesn\\'t require the user to give permissions, so it\\'s suitable for requests where the application just needs to authenticate itself. This is the case with for example retrieving a playlist. However, note that the access token cannot be refreshed, and that it isn\\'t connected to a specific user.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar clientId = \\'someClientId\\',\\n  clientSecret = \\'someClientSecret\\';\\n\\n// Create the api object with the credentials\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  clientId: clientId,\\n  clientSecret: clientSecret\\n});\\n\\n// Retrieve an access token.\\nspotifyApi.clientCredentialsGrant().then(\\n  function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'The access token expires in \\' + data.body[\\'expires_in\\']);\\n    console.log(\\'The access token is \\' + data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n\\n    // Save the access token so that it\\'s used in future calls\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n  },\\n  function(err) {\\n    console.log(\\'Something went wrong when retrieving an access token\\', err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n#### Implicit Grant flow\\n\\nThe Implicit Grant can be used to allow users to login to your completely client-side application. This method still requires a registered application, but won\\'t expose your client secret.\\nThis method of authentication won\\'t return any refresh tokens, so you will need to fully reauthenticate the user everytime a token expires.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar scopes = [\\'user-read-private\\', \\'user-read-email\\'],\\n  redirectUri = \\'https://example.com/callback\\',\\n  clientId = \\'5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165\\',\\n  state = \\'some-state-of-my-choice\\',\\n  showDialog = true,\\n  responseType = \\'token\\';\\n\\n// Setting credentials can be done in the wrapper\\'s constructor, or using the API object\\'s setters.\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  redirectUri: redirectUri,\\n  clientId: clientId\\n});\\n\\n// Create the authorization URL\\nvar authorizeURL = spotifyApi.createAuthorizeURL(\\n  scopes,\\n  state,\\n  showDialog,\\n  responseType\\n);\\n\\n// https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&state=some-state-of-my-choice&show_dialog=true\\nconsole.log(authorizeURL);\\n```\\n\\nWhen the client returns, it will have a token we can directly pass to the library:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// The code that\\'s returned as a hash fragment query string parameter to the redirect URI\\nvar code = \\'MQCbtKe23z7YzzS44KzZzZgjQa621hgSzHN\\';\\nvar credentials = {\\n  clientId: \\'someClientId\\',\\n  clientSecret: \\'someClientSecret\\',\\n  //Either here\\n  accessToken: code\\n};\\n\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi(credentials);\\n\\n//Or with a method\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(code);\\n```\\n\\n#### Setting credentials\\n\\nCredentials are either set when constructing the API object or set after the object has been created using setters. They can be set all at once or one at a time.\\n\\nUsing setters, getters and resetters.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Use setters to set all credentials one by one\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\'myAccessToken\\');\\nspotifyApi.setRefreshToken(\\'myRefreshToken\\');\\nspotifyApi.setRedirectURI(\\'http://www.example.com/test-callback\\');\\nspotifyApi.setClientId(\\'myOwnClientId\\');\\nspotifyApi.setClientSecret(\\'someSuperSecretString\\');\\n\\n// Set all credentials at the same time\\nspotifyApi.setCredentials({\\n  accessToken: \\'myAccessToken\\',\\n  refreshToken: \\'myRefreshToken\\',\\n  redirectUri: \\'http://www.example.com/test-callback\\',\\n  \\'clientId \\': \\'myClientId\\',\\n  clientSecret: \\'myClientSecret\\'\\n});\\n\\n// Get the credentials one by one\\nconsole.log(\\'The access token is \\' + spotifyApi.getAccessToken());\\nconsole.log(\\'The refresh token is \\' + spotifyApi.getRefreshToken());\\nconsole.log(\\'The redirectURI is \\' + spotifyApi.getRedirectURI());\\nconsole.log(\\'The client ID is \\' + spotifyApi.getClientId());\\nconsole.log(\\'The client secret is \\' + spotifyApi.getClientSecret());\\n\\n// Get all credentials\\nconsole.log(\\'The credentials are \\' + spotifyApi.getCredentials());\\n\\n// Reset the credentials\\nspotifyApi.resetAccessToken();\\nspotifyApi.resetRefreshToken();\\nspotifyApi.resetRedirectURI();\\nspotifyApi.resetClientId();\\nspotifyApi.resetClientSecret();\\nspotifyApi.resetCode();\\n\\n// Reset all credentials at the same time\\nspotifyApi.resetCredentials();\\n```\\n\\nUsing the constructor.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Set necessary parts of the credentials on the constructor\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  clientId: \\'myClientId\\',\\n  clientSecret: \\'myClientSecret\\'\\n});\\n\\n// Get an access token and \\'save\\' it using a setter\\nspotifyApi.clientCredentialsGrant().then(\\n  function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'The access token is \\' + data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\'access_token\\']);\\n  },\\n  function(err) {\\n    console.log(\\'Something went wrong!\\', err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Set the credentials when making the request\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  accessToken: \\'njd9wng4d0ycwnn3g4d1jm30yig4d27iom5lg4d3\\'\\n});\\n\\n// Do search using the access token\\nspotifyApi.searchTracks(\\'artist:Love\\').then(\\n  function(data) {\\n    console.log(data.body);\\n  },\\n  function(err) {\\n    console.log(\\'Something went wrong!\\', err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Set the credentials when making the request\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\n  accessToken: \\'njd9wng4d0ycwnn3g4d1jm30yig4d27iom5lg4d3\\'\\n});\\n\\n// Get tracks in a playlist\\napi\\n  .getPlaylistTracks(\\'3ktAYNcRHpazJ9qecm3ptn\\', {\\n    offset: 1,\\n    limit: 5,\\n    fields: \\'items\\'\\n  })\\n  .then(\\n    function(data) {\\n      console.log(\\'The playlist contains these tracks\\', data.body);\\n    },\\n    function(err) {\\n      console.log(\\'Something went wrong!\\', err);\\n    }\\n  );\\n```\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nSee something you think can be improved?

That is the reason I started this project.\\n\\nI found that there weren\\'t many resources on building a proper real-world scale application, and that\\'s my focus for sharing. I made a [Jira clone application][jira] as the first one for that purpose. [Nx workspace][nx] is getting more and more attention from the Angular community, but people are always confused about how to architect and set up an Nx project. I hope Angular Spotify will give you more insight on that even though it is my first project using Nx 🤣\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou know I am one of the moderators of [Angular Vietnam][angularvn]. Recently, I also started [Angular Singapore][angularsg]. This piece of work is my other long-term plan to bring Angular knowledge to more people. I desire to advocate and grow the Angular developer community in Singapore and Vietnam :)\\n\\n## Tech stack\\n\\n![Tech logos][stack]\\n\\n- [Angular 12][angular]\\n- [Nx Workspace][nx]\\n- [ngneat][] packages includes: `ngneat/svg-icon` and `ngneat/until-destroy`\\n- [ngrx][ngrx] and [ngrx/component-store][component-store]\\n- [ng-zorro][ng-zorro] UI component: `tooltip`, `modal`, `slider`, `switch` and more.\\n- [TailwindCSS][tailwind] - See this video [Everything you need to know about TailwindCSS and Angular applications](https://youtu.be/zSXdJqEPy9w) by [@nartc][nartc] for integration TailwindCSS with Angular\\n- [Netlify][netlify] for deployment\\n\\n[angular]: https://angular.io/\\n[ngrx]: https://ngrx.io/\\n[component-store]: https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store\\n[tailwind]: https://tailwindcss.com/\\n[ng-zorro]: https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en\\n[netlify]: http://netlify.com/\\n[ngneat]: https://github.com/ngneat\\n\\nI experimented with the ngrx/component store for `AuthStore` and `UIStore`. It might not be a best practice, and I will refactor it very soon. Just FYI 🤣\\n\\n## High-level design\\n\\nSee my original notes on [Nx workspace structure for NestJS and Angular][gist]\\n\\n### Principles\\n\\nAll components are following:\\n\\n- OnPush Change Detection and async pipes: all components use observable and async pipe for rendering data without any single manual subscribe. Only some places are calling subscribe for dispatching an action, which I will have a refactor live stream session with my friend [@nartc][nartc] to use the component store for a fully subscribe-less application.\\n- SCAMs (single component Angular modules) for tree-shakable components, meaning each component will have a respective module. For example, a RegisterComponent will have a corresponding RegisterModule. We won\\'t declare RegisterComponent as part of AuthModule, for instance.\\n- Mostly, everything will stay in the `libs` folder. New modules, new models, new configurations, new components etc... are in libs. libs should be separated into different directories based on existing apps. We won\\'t put them inside the apps folder. For example in an Angular, contains the `main.ts`, `app.component.ts` and `app.module.ts`\\n\\n### Structure\\n\\nI followed the structure recommended by my friend [@nartc][nartc]. Below is the simplified version of the application structure.\\n\\n```\\n.\\n└── root\\n    ├── apps\\n    │   └── angular-spotify\\n    └── libs\\n        └── web (dir)\\n            ├── shell (dir)\\n            │   ├── feature (angular:lib) - for configure any forRoot modules\\n            │   └── ui\\n            │       └── layout (angular:lib)\\n            ├── settings (dir)\\n            │   ├── feature (angular:lib) - for configure and persist all settings\\n            │   └── data-access (workspace:lib) - store and services for settings module\\n            ├── playlist (dir)\\n            │   ├── data-access (angular:lib, service, state management)\\n            │   ├── features\\n            │   │   ├── list (angular:lib PlaylistsComponent)\\n            │   │   └── detail (angular:lib PlaylistDetailComopnent)\\n            │   └── ui (dir)\\n            │       └── playlist-track (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\n            ├── visualizer (dir)\\n            │   ├── data-access (angular:lib)\\n            │   ├── feature\\n            │   └── ui (angular:lib)\\n            ├── home (dir)\\n            │   ├── data-access (angular:lib)\\n            │   ├── feature (angular:lib)\\n            │   └── ui (dir)\\n            │       ├── featured-playlists (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\n            │       ├── greeting (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\n            │       └── recent-played (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\n            └── shared (dir)\\n                ├── app-config (injection token for environment)\\n                ├── data-access (angular:lib, API call, Service or State management to share across the Client app)\\n                ├── ui (dir)\\n                ├── pipes (dir)\\n                ├── directives (dir)\\n                └── utils (angular:lib, usually shared Guards, Interceptors, Validators...)\\n```\\n\\n### Authentication Flow\\n\\nI follow `Implicit Grant Flow` that Spotify recommended for client-side only applications and did not involve secret keys. The issued access tokens are short-lived, and there are no refresh tokens to extend them when they expire.\\n\\nView the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)\\n\\n- Upon opening Angular Spotify, It will redirect you to Spotify to get access to your data. Angular Spotify only uses the data purely for displaying on the UI. We won\\'t store your information anywhere else.\\n- Angular Spotify only keeps the access token in the browser memory without even storing it into browser local storage. If you do a hard refresh on the browser, It will ask for a new access token from Spotify. One access token is only valid for **one hour**.\\n- After having the token, I\\'ll try to connect to the Web Playback SDK with a new player - `Angular Spotify Web Player`\\n\\n![Angular Spotify Web Playback SDK flow][sdk-flow]\\n\\n### Dependency Graph\\n\\nNx provides an [dependency graph][dep-graph-nx] out of the box. To view it on your browser, clone my repository and run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run dep-graph\\n```\\n\\nA simplified graph looks like the following. It gives you insightful information for your mono repo and is especially helpful when multiple projects depend on each other.\\n\\n![Angular Spotify Dependency Graph][dep-graph]\\n\\n### Nx Computation Cache\\n\\nHaving Nx Cloud configured shortens the deployment time quite a lot.\\n\\nNx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly. Visit [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/) to learn more.\\n\\n![Nx cloud][nx-cloud]\\n\\n## Features and Roadmap\\n\\nI set a tentative deadline for motivating myself to finish the work on time. Otherwise, It will take forever to complete :)\\n\\n### 1.0 - Simple Spotify client\\n\\n> March 01 - 28, 2021\\n\\n- [x] Proven, scalable, and easy to understand the structure with Nx workspace\\n- [x] Play music using Spotify SDK\\n- [x] Load a maximum of 50 save playlists and top 100 songs per playlist.\\n- [x] Cool visualization\\n\\n## Live stream\\n\\nLet work on it together!\\n\\nI scheduled a few live stream sessions to show you how I continue developing Angular Spotify.

An access token is required for all endpoints.\\n\\nIf you want to use a Promises/A+ library, you can set it:\\n\\n```js\\nspotifyApi.setPromiseImplementation(Q);\\n```\\n\\nHere you see how to get basic information using a function like `getArtistAlbums`:\\n\\n```js\\n// get Elvis\\' albums, passing a callback. When a callback is passed, no Promise is returned\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\', function (err, data) {\\n  if (err) console.error(err);\\n  else console.log(\\'Artist albums\\', data);\\n});\\n\\n// get Elvis\\' albums, using Promises through Promise, Q or when\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\').then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Artist albums\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThe promises also expose an `abort` method that aborts the XMLHttpRequest. This is useful to cancel\\nrequests that were made earlier and could be resolved out-of-sync:\\n\\n```js\\nvar prev = null;\\n\\nfunction onUserInput(queryTerm) {\\n  // abort previous request, if any\\n  if (prev !== null) {\\n    prev.abort();\\n  }\\n\\n  // store the current promise in case we need to abort it\\n  prev = spotifyApi.searchTracks(queryTerm, { limit: 5 });\\n  prev.then(\\n    function (data) {\\n      // clean the promise so it doesn\\'t call abort\\n      prev = null;\\n\\n      // ...render list of search results...\\n    },\\n    function (err) {\\n      console.error(err);\\n    }\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe functions that fetch data from the API support also an optional JSON object with a set of options, such as the ones regarding pagination. These options will be sent as query parameters:\\n\\n```js\\n// passing a callback - get Elvis\\' albums in range [20...29]\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\n  \\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\',\\n  { limit: 10, offset: 20 },\\n  function (err, data) {\\n    if (err) console.error(err);\\n    else console.log(\\'Artist albums\\', data);\\n  }\\n);\\n\\n// using Promises through Promise, Q or when - get Elvis\\' albums in range [20...29]\\nspotifyApi\\n  .getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\', { limit: 10, offset: 20 })\\n  .then(\\n    function (data) {\\n      console.log(\\'Album information\\', data);\\n    },\\n    function (err) {\\n      console.error(err);\\n    }\\n  );\\n```\\n\\n### More examples\\n\\n_Note: The following examples use Promises/Q/when as the return object._\\n\\nHere you can see more examples of the usage of this wrapper:\\n\\n```js\\n// get multiple albums\\nspotifyApi.getAlbums([\\'5U4W9E5WsYb2jUQWePT8Xm\\', \\'3KyVcddATClQKIdtaap4bV\\']).then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Albums information\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n\\n// get an artists\\nspotifyApi.getArtist(\\'2hazSY4Ef3aB9ATXW7F5w3\\').then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Artist information\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n\\n// get multiple artists\\nspotifyApi\\n  .getArtists([\\'2hazSY4Ef3aB9ATXW7F5w3\\', \\'6J6yx1t3nwIDyPXk5xa7O8\\'])\\n  .then(\\n    function (data) {\\n      console.log(\\'Artists information\\', data);\\n    },\\n    function (err) {\\n      console.error(err);\\n    }\\n  );\\n\\n// get albums by a certain artist\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\').then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Artist albums\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n\\n// search tracks whose name, album or artist contains \\'Love\\'\\nspotifyApi.searchTracks(\\'Love\\').then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Search by \"Love\"\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n\\n// search artists whose name contains \\'Love\\'\\nspotifyApi.searchArtists(\\'Love\\').then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Search artists by \"Love\"\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n\\n// search tracks whose artist\\'s name contains \\'Love\\'\\nspotifyApi.searchTracks(\\'artist:Love\\').then(\\n  function (data) {\\n    console.log(\\'Search tracks by \"Love\" in the artist name\\', data);\\n  },\\n  function (err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Nesting calls\\n\\nWhen you need to make multiple calls to get some dataset, you can take advantage of the Promises to get a cleaner code:\\n\\n```js\\n// track detail information for album tracks\\nspotifyApi\\n  .getAlbum(\\'5U4W9E5WsYb2jUQWePT8Xm\\')\\n  .then(function (data) {\\n    return data.tracks.map(function (t) {\\n      return t.id;\\n    });\\n  })\\n  .then(function (trackIds) {\\n    return spotifyApi.getTracks(trackIds);\\n  })\\n  .then(function (tracksInfo) {\\n    console.log(tracksInfo);\\n  })\\n  .catch(function (error) {\\n    console.error(error);\\n  });\\n\\n// album detail for the first 10 Elvis\\' albums\\nspotifyApi\\n  .getArtistAlbums(\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\', { limit: 10 })\\n  .then(function (data) {\\n    return data.albums.map(function (a) {\\n      return a.id;\\n    });\\n  })\\n  .then(function (albums) {\\n    return spotifyApi.getAlbums(albums);\\n  })\\n  .then(function (data) {\\n    console.log(data);\\n  });\\n```\\n\\n### Getting user\\'s information\\n\\nIn order to get user\\'s information you need to request a user-signed access token, from either the Implicit Grant or Authorization Code flow. Say for instance you want to get user\\'s playlists. Once you get an access token, set it and fetch the data:\\n\\n```js\\n// get an access token\\n...\\n\\n// set it in the wrapper\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\'<here_your_access_token>\\');\\nspotifyApi.getUserPlaylists(\\'jmperezperez\\')\\n  .then(function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'User playlists\\', data);\\n  }, function(err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  });\\n\\nspotifyApi.getPlaylist(\\'4vHIKV7j4QcZwgzGQcZg1x\\')\\n  .then(function(data) {\\n    console.log(\\'User playlist\\', data);\\n  }, function(err) {\\n    console.error(err);\\n  });\\n```\\n\\nSome functions don\\'t need to receive the user\\'s id as a parameter, and will use the\\nuser\\'s information from the access token:\\n\\n```js\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\'<here_your_access_token>\\');\\nspotifyApi\\n  .getUserPlaylists() // note that we don\\'t pass a user id\\n  .then(\\n    function (data) {\\n      console.log(\\'User playlists\\', data);\\n    },\\n    function (err) {\\n      console.error(err);\\n    }\\n  );\\n```\\n\\n## Integrated Typescript Typings\\n\\nGet great code completion for this package using the integrated typescript typings. It includes the complete typings of the Spotify Web Api too, so you\\'ll know both how to the navigate the API as well as the response you are getting.\\n\\n![Typings Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js/master/typings-example.gif)\\n\\n### When bundling the library\\n\\nIf you are bundling spotify-web-api-js using e.g. webpack you can include the library and the typings into a typescript file like this:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport SpotifyWebApi from \\'spotify-web-api-js\\';\\n\\nlet spotify = new SpotifyWebApi();\\n```\\n\\n### When using the library globally\\n\\nIf you are using the library globally, for example including directly from index.html, include the typings in the top of your typescript file. Typescript will then assume the library is already present globally. Adjust the path to `node_modules`.\\n\\n```typescript\\n/// <reference path=\"../node_modules/spotify-web-api-js/src/typings/spotify-web-api.d.ts\" />\\n\\nlet spotify = new SpotifyWebApi();\\n```\\n\\n## Running tests\\n\\nIn order to run the tests, run:\\n\\n    $ npm test\\n\\nIf you want to check out the coverage, run:\\n\\n    $ npm run test:coverage\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': '# Spotify iOS SDK\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Spotify iOS framework allows your application to interact with the Spotify app running in the background on a user\\'s device. Capabilities include authorizing, getting metadata for the currently playing track and context, as well as issuing playback commands.\\n\\n**Please Note:** By using Spotify developer tools you accept our [Developer Terms of Use](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/terms/).\\n\\nThe Spotify iOS SDK is a set of lightweight objects that connect with the Spotify app and let you control it while all the heavy lifting of playback is offloaded to the Spotify app itself. The Spotify app takes care of playback, networking, offline caching and OS music integration, leaving you to focus on your user experience.  Moving from your app to the Spotify app and vice versa is a streamlined experience where playback and metadata always stay in sync.\\n\\n[Key Features](#key-features)\\n\\n[Filing Bugs](#filing-bugs)\\n\\n[Components](#components)\\n\\n[How Do App Remote Calls Work?](#how-do-app-remote-calls-work)\\n\\n[Terms of Use](#terms-of-use)\\n\\n[Tutorial](#tutorial)\\n\\n[Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\\n\\n### Key Features\\n\\n* Playback is always in sync with Spotify app\\n* Playback, networking, and caching is all accounted for by the Spotify app\\n* Works offline and online and does not require Web API calls to get metadata for player state\\n* Allows authentication through the Spotify app so users don\\'t have to type in their credentials\\n\\n### Filing Bugs\\n\\nWe love feedback from the developer community, so please feel free to file missing features or bugs over at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/spotify/ios-app-remote-sdk/issues).\\nMake sure you search existing issues before creating new ones.\\n\\n[Open bug tickets](https://github.com/spotify/ios-app-remote-sdk/labels/bug) | [Open feature requests](https://github.com/spotify/ios-app-remote-sdk/labels/feature%20request)\\n\\n### Requirements\\n\\nThe Spotify iOS framework requires a deployment target of iOS 9 or higher. The\\nfollowing architectures are supported: `armv7`, `armv7s` and `arm64` for devices,\\n`i386` and `x86_64` for the iOS Simulator. Bitcode is also supported.\\n\\n## Components\\n\\n### Models\\n\\n* `SPTAppRemoteAlbum`\\n* `SPTAppRemoteArtist`\\n* `SPTAppRemoteLibraryState`\\n* `SPTAppRemotePlaybackRestrictions`\\n* `SPTAppRemotePlaybackOptions`\\n* `SPTAppRemotePlayerState`\\n* `SPTAppRemoteTrack`\\n* `SPTAppRemoteContentItem`\\n* `SPTAppRemoteUserCapabilities`\\n* `SPTAppRemoteImageRepresentable`\\n* `SPTConfiguration`\\n\\n### SPTAppRemote\\n\\nThe main entry point to connect to the Spotify app and retrieve API components. Use this to establish, monitor, and terminate the connection.\\n\\n### SPTAppRemotePlayerAPI\\n\\nSend playback related commands such as:\\n\\n* Play track by URI\\n* Resume/pause playback\\n* Skip forwards and backwards\\n* Seek to position\\n* Set shuffle on/off\\n* Request player state\\n* Request player context\\n* Subscribe to player state\\n\\n### SPTAppRemoteImagesAPI\\n\\nFetch an image for a `SPTAppRemoteImageRepresentable`\\n\\n### SPTAppRemoteUserAPI\\n\\nFetch/subscribe/set user-related data such as:\\n\\n* Fetch and/or subscribe to `SPTAppRemoteUserCapabilities`\\n* Determine if a user can play songs on demand (Premium vs Free)\\n* Add/remove/check if a song is in a user\\'s library\\n\\n### SPTAppRemoteContentAPI\\n\\nFetch recommended content for the user.\\n\\n## How App Remote calls work\\n\\nWhen you interact with any of the App Remote APIs you pass in a `SPTAppRemoteCallback` block that gets invoked with either the expected result item or an `NSError` if the operation failed. The block is triggered after the command was received by the Spotify app (or if the connection could not be made).\\n\\nHere is an example using the `SPTRemotePlayerAPI` to skip a song:\\n\\n```objective-c\\n[appRemote.playerAPI skipToNext:^(id  _Nullable result, NSError * _Nullable error) {\\n    if (error) {\\n        // Operation failed\\n    } else {\\n        // Operation succeeded\\n    }\\n}];\\n```\\n\\n### Tutorial and Examples\\n\\nWe provide a few sample projects to help you get started with the iOS Framework in the DemoProjects folder. See the [Readme](DemoProjects/README.md) in the DemoProjects folder for more information on what each sample does.\\n\\n### Authentication and Authorization\\n\\nTo communicate with the Spotify app your application will need to get a user\\'s permission to control playback first by using built-in authorization for App Remote. To do that you will need to request authorization view when connecting to Spotify. The framework will automatically request the `app-remote-control` scope and show the auth view if user hasn\\'t agreed to it yet.\\n\\n## Terms of Use\\n\\nNote that by using Spotify developer tools, you accept our [Developer Terms of Use](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/terms/).\\n\\n### Included Open Source Libraries\\n\\n* [MPMessagePack](https://github.com/gabriel/MPMessagePack)\\n\\n## Tutorial\\n\\nThis tutorial leads you step-by-step through the creation of a simple app that uses the Spotify iOS SDK to play an audio track and subscribe to player state. It will walk through the authorization flow.\\n\\n### Prepare Your Environment\\n\\nFollow these steps to make sure you are prepared to start coding.\\n\\n* Download the Spotify iOS framework from the \"Clone or download\" button at the top of this page, and unzip it.\\n* Install the latest version of Spotify from the App Store onto the device you will be using for development. Run the Spotify app and login or sign up.\\n**Note:** A **Spotify Premium** account will be required to play a track on-demand for a uri.\\n* [Register Your Application](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app). You will need to register your application at [My Applications](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and obtain a client ID. When you register your app you will also need to whitelist a redirect URI that the Spotify app will use to callback to your app after authorization.\\n\\n### Add Dependencies\\n\\n1. Add the `SpotifyiOS.framework` or `SpotifyiOS.xcframework` to your Xcode project.\\n\\n    ![Import SpotifyiOS.framework](img/import_sdk.png)\\n\\n2. In your info.plist add your redirect URI you registered at [My Applications](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). You will need to add your redirect URI under \"URL types\" and \"URL Schemes\". Be sure to set a unique \"URL identifier\" as well. [More info on URL Schemes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1)\\n\\n    ![Info.plist](img/info_plist.png)\\n\\n3. Add `#import <SpotifyiOS/SpotifyiOS.h>` to your source files to import necessary headers.\\n\\n### Check if Spotify is Active\\n\\nIf a user is already using Spotify, but has not authorized your application, you can use the following check to prompt them to\\nstart the authorization process.\\n\\n```objective-c\\n[SPTAppRemote checkIfSpotifyAppIsActive:^(BOOL active) {\\n    if (active) {\\n        // Prompt the user to connect Spotify here\\n    }\\n}];\\n```\\n\\n### Authorize Your Application\\n\\nTo be able to use the playback control part of the SDK the user needs to authorize your application. If they haven\\'t, the connection will fail with a `No token provided` error. To allow the user to authorize your app, you can use the built-in authorization flow.\\n\\n1. Initialize `SPTConfiguration` with your client ID and redirect URI.\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    SPTConfiguration *configuration =\\n        [[SPTConfiguration alloc] initWithClientID:@\"your_client_id\" redirectURL:[NSURL urlWithString:@\"your_redirect_uri\"]];\\n    ```\\n\\n2. Initialize `SPTAppRemote` with your `SPTConfiguration`\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    self.appRemote = [[SPTAppRemote alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration logLevel:SPTAppRemoteLogLevelDebug];\\n    ```\\n\\n3. Initiate the authentication flow (for other ways to detect if Spotify is installed, as well as attributing installs, please see our [Content Linking Guide](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/content-linking-guide/)).\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    // Note: A blank string will play the user\\'s last song or pick a random one.\\n    BOOL spotifyInstalled = [self.appRemote authorizeAndPlayURI:@\"spotify:track:69bp2EbF7Q2rqc5N3ylezZ\"];\\n    if (!spotifyInstalled) {\\n        /*\\n        * The Spotify app is not installed.\\n        * Use SKStoreProductViewController with [SPTAppRemote spotifyItunesItemIdentifier] to present the user\\n        * with a way to install the Spotify app.\\n        */\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n4. Configure your `AppDelegate` to parse out the accessToken in `application:openURL:options:` and set it on the `SPTAppRemote` connectionParameters.\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options\\n    {\\n        NSDictionary *params = [self.appRemote authorizationParametersFromURL:url];\\n        NSString *token = params[SPTAppRemoteAccessTokenKey];\\n        if (token) {\\n            self.appRemote.connectionParameters.accessToken = token;\\n        } else if (params[SPTAppRemoteErrorDescriptionKey]) {\\n            NSLog(@\"%@\", params[SPTAppRemoteErrorDescriptionKey]);\\n        }\\n        return YES;\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n    If you are using UIScene then you need to use appropriate method in your scene delegate.\\n\\n    ```swift\\n    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {\\n        guard let url = URLContexts.first?.url else {\\n            return\\n        }\\n\\n        let parameters = appRemote.authorizationParameters(from: url);\\n\\n        if let access_token = parameters?[SPTAppRemoteAccessTokenKey] {\\n            appRemote.connectionParameters.accessToken = access_token\\n            self.accessToken = access_token\\n        } else if let error_description = parameters?[SPTAppRemoteErrorDescriptionKey] {\\n            // Show the error\\n        }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n### Connect and Subscribe to Player State\\n\\n1. Set your connection delegate and attempt to connect.\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    self.appRemote.delegate = self;\\n    [self.appRemote connect];\\n    ```\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n\\n    - (void)appRemoteDidEstablishConnection:(SPTAppRemote *)appRemote\\n    {\\n        // Connection was successful, you can begin issuing commands\\n    }\\n\\n    - (void)appRemote:(SPTAppRemote *)appRemote didFailConnectionAttemptWithError:(NSError *)error\\n    {\\n        // Connection failed\\n    }\\n\\n    - (void)appRemote:(SPTAppRemote *)appRemote didDisconnectWithError:(nullable NSError *)error\\n    {\\n        // Connection disconnected\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n2. Set a delegate and subscribe to player state:\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    appRemote.playerAPI.delegate = self;\\n\\n    [appRemote.playerAPI subscribeToPlayerState:^(id  _Nullable result, NSError * _Nullable error) {\\n        // Handle Errors\\n    }];\\n    ```\\n\\n    ```objective-c\\n    - (void)playerStateDidChange:(id<SPTAppRemotePlayerState>)playerState\\n    {\\n        NSLog(@\"Track name: %@\", playerState.track.name);\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n**Why does music need to be playing to connect with `SPTAppRemote`?**\\n\\nMusic must be playing when you connect with `SPTAppRemote` to ensure the Spotify app is not suspended in the background. iOS applications can only stay active in the background for a few seconds unless they are actively doing something like navigation or playing music.\\n\\n**Is SpotifyiOS.framework thread safe?**\\n\\nNo, the framework currently expects to be called from the main thread. It will offload most of its work to a background thread internally but callbacks to your code will also occur on the main thread.\\n\\n**What if I need to authorize without starting playback?**\\n\\nThere is an alternative authorization method. You can find more information about that [here](docs/auth.md).\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': '# librespot\\n*librespot* is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables\\napplications to use Spotify\\'s service, without using the official but\\nclosed-source libspotify. Additionally, it will provide extra features\\nwhich are not available in the official library.\\n\\nNote: librespot only works with Spotify Premium.\\n\\n# Unmaintained\\nUnfortunately I am unable to maintain librespot anymore. It should still work,\\nbut issues and Pull requests will be ignored. Feel free to fork it and continue\\ndevelopment there. If a fork gains traction I will happily point to it from the\\nREADME.\\n\\n## Building\\nRust 1.17.0 or later is required to build librespot.\\n\\n**If you are building librespot on macOS, the homebrew provided rust may fail due to the way in which homebrew installs rust. In this case, uninstall the homebrew version of rust and use [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/), and librespot should then build.** \\n\\nIt also requires a C, with portaudio.\\n\\nOn debian / ubuntu, the following command will install these dependencies :\\n```shell\\nsudo apt-get install build-essential portaudio19-dev\\n```\\n\\nOn Fedora systems, the following command will install these dependencies :\\n```shell\\nsudo dnf install portaudio-devel make gcc\\n```\\n\\nOn macOS, using homebrew :\\n```shell\\nbrew install portaudio\\n```\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve cloned this repository you can build *librespot* using `cargo`.\\n```shell\\ncargo build --release\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\nA sample program implementing a headless Spotify Connect receiver is provided.\\nOnce you\\'ve built *librespot*, run it using :\\n```shell\\ntarget/release/librespot --username USERNAME --cache CACHEDIR --name DEVICENAME\\n```\\n\\n## Discovery mode\\n*librespot* can be run in discovery mode, in which case no password is required at startup.\\nFor that, simply omit the `--username` argument.\\n\\n## Audio Backends\\n*librespot* supports various audio backends. Multiple backends can be enabled at compile time by enabling the\\ncorresponding cargo feature. By default, only PortAudio is enabled.\\n\\nA specific backend can selected at runtime using the `--backend` switch.\\n\\n```shell\\ncargo build --features portaudio-backend\\ntarget/release/librespot [...] --backend portaudio\\n```\\n\\nThe following backends are currently available :\\n- ALSA\\n- PortAudio \\n- PulseAudio\\n\\n## Cross-compiling\\nA cross compilation environment is provided as a docker image.\\nBuild the image from the root of the project with the following command :\\n\\n```\\n$ docker build -t librespot-cross -f contrib/Dockerfile .\\n```\\n\\nThe resulting image can be used to build librespot for linux x86_64, armhf (compatible e. g. with Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, but not with Raspberry Pi 1 or Zero) and armel.\\nThe compiled binaries will be located in /tmp/librespot-build\\n\\n```\\ndocker run -v /tmp/librespot-build:/build librespot-cross\\n```\\n\\nIf only one architecture is desired, cargo can be invoked directly with the appropriate options :\\n```shell\\ndocker run -v /tmp/librespot-build:/build librespot-cross cargo build --release --no-default-features --features alsa-backend\\ndocker run -v /tmp/librespot-build:/build librespot-cross cargo build --release --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --no-default-features --features alsa-backend\\ndocker run -v /tmp/librespot-build:/build librespot-cross cargo build --release --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi --no-default-features --features alsa-backend\\n```\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to set the `with-tremor` feature flag if your target device does not have floating-point capabilities.\\n\\n## Development\\nWhen developing *librespot*, it is preferable to use Rust nightly, and build it using the following :\\n```shell\\ncargo build --no-default-features --features \"nightly portaudio-backend\"\\n```\\n\\nThis produces better compilation error messages than with the default configuration.\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\nUsing this code to connect to Spotify\\'s API is probably forbidden by them.\\nUse at your own risk.\\n\\n## Contact\\nCome and hang out on gitter if you need help or want to offer some.\\nhttps://gitter.im/sashahilton00/spotify-connect-resources\\n\\n## License\\nEverything in this repository is licensed under the MIT license.\\n\\n'},\n",

The goal for EZBlocker is to be the most reliable ad blocker for Spotify.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an advertisement is playing, EZBlocker will mute Spotify until it's over.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo download a pre-compiled binary of the latest version, click [here][1]. For more info, visit the [EZBlocker project page][2].\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical overview\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current version of EZBlocker hooks Spotify in three ways: window titles, audio sessions, and a reverse listener. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Window title**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe window title is used to grab the name of the currently playing song/artist/advertisement. EZBlocker also uses the window title to grab the Spotify process handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Audio session**\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing lower level COM interfaces, EZBlocker is able to both find and extract information from Spotify's audio session. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, if the Spotify window is hidden (in the tray), its window title cannot be used locate the correct Spotify process handle. In this case, EZBlocker falls back to searching through the audio sessions to find the correct process.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the audio session is a somewhat reliable way to detect whether or not a song/advertisement is playing regardless of whether or not the Spotify window is hidden. It can be inaccurate at times, eg. when a song has a 3 second gap of no sound, but can automatically recover.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Reverse Listener**\\r\\n\\r\\nI've historically tried to avoid modifying the Spotify application, but since the shutdown of its unofficial local API (in mid July 2018), there was no reliable way to detect if an advertisement was playing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpotify is built with the Chromium Embedded Framework, which means many of its components are written in HTML/JS. EZBlocker patches one of them to attach a web worker that sends a signal to a local listener when an advertisement is playing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore data could probably be extracted through the web worker, but I haven't had time to explore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changelog (Major releases only):\\r\\n- V 1.8 (Oct 31, 2021):\\r\\n  - New muting logic, reduces false positives (podcasts no longer muted)\\r\\n  - Cleanup and bugfixes\\r\\n- V 1.7 (July 22, 2018):\\r\\n  - Almost a complete re-write of the application (lighter, more performant, cleaner code)\\r\\n  - New Spotify ad detection and muting logic after Spotify's shutdown of its local API\\r\\n- V 1.6 (March 10, 2016):\\r\\n  - Better handling of Spotify updates/restarts\\r\\n  - Fix bugs caused by newer Spotify local API\\r\\n  - Update dependencies\\r\\n  - Now requires .NET Framework 4.5\\r\\n\\r\\n## Translations\\r\\nTo better support non-English speakers, I've started an effort to translate EZBlocker. Please reach out if you are a native speaker of a non-English language. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are contributors to this goal:\\r\\n- Portuguese: Raí\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: http://www.ericzhang.me/dl/?file=EZBlocker.php\\r\\n  [2]: http://www.ericzhang.me/projects/spotify-ad-blocker-ezblocker/\\r\\n\"},\n",

It automatically splits songs into separate tracks and records to MP3 with media metadata, meaning you can easily start enjoying your music offline.\\n\\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Spotify Recorder logs\" src=\"https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/assets/images/ui_record.png\" /></p>\\n\\n### [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)\\n\\nSpytify records what Spotify outputs, which is a longer process than downloading a Spotify playlist with a tool.\\n\\nHowever, Spytify ensures that all tracks will be the official released one, all sound volume normalized and with media tags and album cover. Playlist Downloaders get mostly all tracks from YouTube which means that they can\\'t guarantee the choosen track will fit 100% the one in your playlist and they will all be the same quality.\\n\\nSpytify records the same quality that Spotify outputs ([Spotify Free 160kbps, Spotify Premium 320kbps](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/audio-quality/)), so the recorded copy will be indistinguishable from Spotify’s one.\\n\\n### [How to install it?](#how-to-install-it)\\n\\nFollow the steps shown in the F.A.Q section : [_How to install Spytify?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#install-spytify)\\n\\n### [How to use it?](#how-to-use-it)\\n\\nA standard use is to start a recording session using your favorite playlist and let it record overnight, so you avoid waiting for it to end, because Spytify does not download but records. You will then get all your songs automatically split into separate tracks without ads and with metadata.\\n\\nA recorder requires a good sound card to be able to record good quality, that\\'s why Spytify comes with a Virtual Audio Cable device, if you have issues with your sound card (volume slider and other apps sound affects the recordings, or overall recorded sound quality is worst than Spotify) you can install this virtual device using the **Speakers+** icon in Spytify settings.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to hit the [F.A.Q.](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html) for tips on:\\n\\n- [_How to install Virtual Audio Cable device for better recording quality?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#install-better-audio-endpoint-device)\\n- [_How to isolate Spytify and Spotify on a virtual audio device to avoid background noises?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#isolate-spotify-audio-endpoint)\\n- [_How to reroute sound/output of a virtual audio device to my main audio device to listen to it?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#listen-to-virtual-device)\\n- [_How to connect to Spotify API for more accurate media tags?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#media-tags-not-found)\\n\\n\\n### [Features](#features)\\n\\nSplits the recorded sound into individual tracks using the artist and track names as the title, like so:\\n> Artist - Track.mp3\\n  \\nSaves all recordings under the same path:\\n> ../My Music/\\n  \\nAutomatically adds metadata from Last.fm (or [Spotify API](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#media-tags-not-found)) to .mp3 file:\\n\\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Recorded songs with album cover and media tags in Windows Explorer\" src=\"https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/assets/images/saved_songs_list.png\" /></p>\\n\\n### [Requirements](#requirements)\\n\\nSpytify runs on Windows only.\\n\\n- Microsoft Framework ([.NET 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=49981) or higher).\\n- Spotify Desktop application.\\n\\nA **free Spotify account** will work, but Spotify restricts audio quality to 160 kbps.

something.getName());\\n  } catch (Exception e) {\\n    System.out.println(\"Something went wrong!\\\\n\" + e.getMessage());\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Authorization\\n**Please see [Spotify\\'s Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) too!**\\n\\nFor authorization requests the API object requires at least to have\\n[your application](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications)\\'s client ID and client secret set as its properties.\\nWhen using the authorization code flow, the application\\'s redirect URI is required too. Those properties will then be\\nautomatically used by functions that depend on them.\\n\\n```Java\\nSpotifyApi spotifyApi = new SpotifyApi.Builder()\\n  .setClientId(\"<your_client_id>\")\\n  .setClientSecret(\"<your_client_secret>\")\\n  .setRedirectUri(\"<your_redirect_uri>\")\\n  .build();\\n```\\n\\nThere are three ways to retrieving an access token:\\n\\n#### [Client Credentials Flow](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)\\nUse the client credentials flow when the requests don\\'t require permission from a specific user. This flow doesn\\'t\\nreturn a refresh token and is useful for simple requests, like fetching albums or searching for tracks.\\n\\nExample: [ClientCredentialsExample.java](examples/authorization/client_credentials/ClientCredentialsExample.java)\\n\\n#### [Authorization Code Flow](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)\\nUsing the authorization code flow to retrieve an access token is necessary if the requests are bound to a specific user.\\nUsing this flow returns a refresh token, which can be used to renew the access token before it expires. This is how it\\nworks:\\n\\n1. The authorization code flow requires a code, which is part of the `redirectUri`\\'s query parameters when the user has\\nopened a custom URL in a browser and authorized the application.\\n\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodeUriExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/AuthorizationCodeUriExample.java)\\n\\n2. When the code has been retrieved, it can be used in another request to get an access token as well as a refresh token.\\n\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodeExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/AuthorizationCodeExample.java)\\n\\n3. Now, the refresh token in turn can be used in a loop to retrieve new access and refresh tokens.\\n\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodeRefreshExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/AuthorizationCodeRefreshExample.java)\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhen you\\'ve fetched an access and refresh token, you have to add them to your API properties for automatic usage in\\nrequests. The implementer has to handle the access token\\'s expiration.\\n\\n```Java\\nspotifyApi\\n  .setAccessToken(\"<your_access_token>\")\\n  .setRefreshToken(\"<your_refresh_token>\")\\n  .build();\\n```\\n\\n#### [Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)\\nThe authorization code flow with PKCE is quite like the Authorization Code Flow except that no client secret is necessary\\n(therefore, it is a good option for mobile and desktop applications). Instead, your application should generate a\\n**code verifier** and a **code challenge** before each authentication request.\\n\\n\\nThe code verifier is a cryptographically random string between 43 and 128 characters in length. It can contain letters, digits, underscores, periods, hyphens, or tildes.\\nTo generate the code challenge, your app should hash the code verifier using the SHA256 algorithm. Then, base64url encode the hash that you generated.\\n\\n\\nThis flow provides your app with an access token which can be refreshed, too.\\nThe steps are similar as above:\\n\\n1. The authorization code flow with PKCE requires a code, which is part of the `redirectUri`\\'s query parameters when the user has\\n   opened a custom URL in a browser and authorized the application. The **code challenge** is supplied to this request as a query parameter.\\n\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodePKCEUriExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/pkce/AuthorizationCodePKCEUriExample.java)\\n\\n2. When the code has been retrieved, it can be used in another request to get an access token as well as a refresh token.\\n   The **code verifier** is supplied to this request a query parameter.\\n\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodePKCEExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/pkce/AuthorizationCodePKCEExample.java)\\n\\n3. Now, the refresh token in turn can be used in a loop to retrieve new access and refresh tokens.\\n\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodePKCERefreshExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/pkce/AuthorizationCodePKCERefreshExample.java)\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhen you have fetched an access and refresh token, you have to add them to your API properties for automatic usage in\\nrequests. The implementer must handle the access token\\'s expiration. The refresh token can be exchanged for an\\naccess token only once, after which it becomes invalid.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Examples\\n- **Albums**\\n  - [Get an Album](examples/data/albums/GetAlbumExample.java)\\n  -

You\\ncan find details about specific parts or single classes in the sections below.\\n\\n#### Enumerations\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/enums/`\\n\\nEnumerations allow elements to \"be of a type\" and limit them to a known value set. They are currently not specified in a\\nunique place, but are rather scrambled across the online reference. Thus, the reference only allows for construction\\nof enum classes from this sparse information.\\n\\n#### Exceptions\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/exceptions/`\\n\\nExceptions are thrown when errors occur. They are following RFC-specified\\n[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) and are packed with a more detailed error\\ndescription.\\n\\n#### Model Objects\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/model_objects/`\\n\\nThe model objects are entities that form the API\\'s responses in arranged formats. They are mostly specified in the\\n[Web API Object Model](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/) and in the\\n[Web API Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/). Though, unreferenced model\\nobjects exist. This project subdivides those into...\\n\\n- \"miscellaneous\" model objects: these are mentioned somewhere in the reference, but not in the model object list\\n- \"special\" model objects: these are not mentioned at all, but appear in API answers nonetheless.\\n\\nJava classes representing those model objects include private instance variables, a private constructor, but public getter\\nmethods as well as an embedded...\\n\\n1. builder class, including the setter functions and a public build method\\n2. JSON-util class, implementing the `createModelObject` method.\\n\\n#### Requests\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/requests/`\\n\\nThe request classes mirror the strucure of Spotify\\'s Web Api endpoints. They are divided into several categories like\\n`authorization`, `data/albums` or `data/tracks`. They must extend from `AbstractDataRequest` and contain an\\nimplementation of the request\\'s `execute` method. They have to embed a builder class too, enabling dynamic request\\ncreation.\\n\\n#### Tests\\n`src/test/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/`\\n\\nUnit tests ensure that implemented features work. This project\\'s unit tests are implemented with [JUnit](http://junit.org/)\\nand [mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) for mocking.\\n\\n##### Fixtures\\n`src/test/fixtures/`\\n\\nFixtures are JSON files that represent the data returned from the API server. We use the examples directly provided by\\nthe [Web API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) with minor tweaks. Tweaks\\nare needed because the reference sometimes contains invalid data examples.\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': \"SpotifyTray-Android\\n===================\\nThis Android project provides simplistic code to produce a floating widget like Facebook's chatheads app. It is supported by Android 2.3.3+ (API 10+).\\n\\nPlease note that it does not provide or include any Spotify music streaming features and is essentially just the UI for demonstration purposes only. Also note that this is not a project developed/endorsed by Spotify.\\n\\n## Features\\nAssume that it's a small muted music player without any audio.\\n- Tray can be dragged around the screen.\\n- Tray, when released, comes back to a specific region on y-axis.\\n- The tray can be tapped to open/close.\\n- The widgets on the tray animate when the tray is between close and open states.\\n- Next and previous music buttons change the current song and hence the album cover changes too. The change is animated.\\n- Play and pause buttons work, but the change is not obvious since there is no audio.\\n- Each song has a duration. After the song has played for that duration, it switches to next song which is evident from the animated change that occurs when next button is pressed. You will notice this if you stay on the first song for 30s.\\n- The widget can be shut down from notification menu.\\n\\n## Demo\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxdTkdNkVs\\n\\n## License\\nMIT License.

On this second version of the manager app, we added a couple of features such as the ability to uninstall, open the app\\'s settings directly, clear the offline cached datas and launch the app. We hope that all users find these newly added features very useful.\\n\\n# Legacy Databases Officially Shutdown (04/01/22)  \\nLegacy databases are now officially shutdown. Update to the latest version of xManager (v3.2) to continue using the app.  \\n\\n**More Info:**  \\n> These are the databases used by \"xSpotify Manager\" up until xManager v1-v3.1. Those databases are very old and deprecated at the same time.

For example, if the application doesn\\'t need to play music but needs user login or Web API capabilities with other [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/) you can use the `Spotify Authentication Library` by itself.\\n\\nHead over to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/) for more reading about the Android SDK.\\n\\n### Spotify App Remote\\n\\nThis library contains classes for music playback control and metadata access.\\nThe built-in authentication in App Remote requests for `app-control-scope` only, and is the only scope needed to use App Remote. No token exchange. If more [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/) are needed for web-api related calls then use `Spotify Authentication Library`.\\n\\n[Spotify App Remote README](app-remote-lib/README.md)\\n\\n### Spotify Authentication Library\\n\\nThis library provides a way to obtain OAuth access tokens that can subsequently be used to play music or used in calls to the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).<br/>\\n[Spotify Authentication Library](https://github.com/spotify/android-auth) is an open source project.\\n\\n[Spotify Authentication Library README](auth-lib/README.md)\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nWalk through the quick start documentation on [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/quick-start).<br/>\\nRun the sample code in [app-remote-sample](app-remote-sample) and [auth-sample](auth-sample) modules.<br/>\\nAdd the libraries as module dependencies to your project.\\n\\n## License\\n\\n```\\nCopyright © 2018 Spotify AB.\\n\\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\\n\\n http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\\nlimitations under the License.\\n```\\n'},\n",

Brought to you by the lovely people at [Benchmark](http://benchmark.co.uk).\\n\\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\\n\\nSimply create a Slash Command, such as `/jukebox`, which accepts a track name (also the artist too for a less fuzzy search) to add to a pre-defined Spotify playlist:\\n\\n    /jukebox Bell Biv DeVoe – Poison\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n### Slack\\n\\nThere are two ways to use slackbox - via a Slash Commands or an Outgoing Webhook:\\n\\n#### Slash Command\\n\\nSlash commands allow for private functions within Slack which will **not** show up in chat history.\\n\\nFirst you\\'ll want to create your Slack Slash Command, which you can do by going to your [Slash Commands page](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands).\\n\\n#### Outgoing WebHook\\n\\nOutgoing webhooks allow data to be exported from Slack channels. Using an outgoing webhook means song additions will be public so users will know when songs are requested and who requested them.\\n\\nFirst you\\'ll want to create your Outgoing Webhook, which you can do by going to your [Outgoing WebHooks page](https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook).\\n\\nOutgoing WebHooks work best with a trigger word. This way only messages with the trigger word (or words) will be parsed and added.\\n\\n**NOTE:** You may only use slash commands _or_ outgoing webhooks. The Slack Token environment variable can only be set once so it needs to be the token from this or the slash command.\\n\\n#### Common\\n\\nDuring setup, have your slash command or outgoing webhook submit a POST to your app\\'s `/store` endpoint, e.g. `https://app-name.herokuapp.com/store`.\\n\\nMake a note of the `token` (either from the slash command or outgoing webhook), as you\\'ll need it later to help guard against cross-site request forgery.\\n\\n### Spotify\\n\\nHead over to [Spotify\\'s Developer Site](http://developer.spotify.com) and create a new Application. Make sure you add whatever slackbox\\'s callback URI as a valid callback URI. If you\\'re running locally, this will be `http://localhost:5000/callback` or on Heroku `https://app-name.herokuapp.com/callback`\\n\\nMake a note of the `key`, `secret` and `callback URI` too, as you\\'ll need these later as well.\\n\\nAlso, don\\'t forget to make a playlist. If you do this through [Spotify\\'s web interface](http://play.spotify.com) then the `playlist identifier` will be the last segment of the URI - make a note of this too! If there\\'s a better way of finding this out, we\\'re all ears. If you do this through the app, right-click the playlist to get it\\'s web URL and again, you need the last segment of the URI.\\n\\n### Environment variables\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve cloned slackbox or hit the \"Deploy with Heroku\" button you\\'ll need to setup the following environment variables. These can either be stored in a `.env` or set up as config variables in Heroku.\\n\\n* `SLACK_TOKEN` - The token from Slack\\'s Slash Command.\\n* `SLACK_OUTGOING` - True if using [Slack Outgoing WebHooks](https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook), false if using [Slack Slash Commands](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands)\\n* `SPOTIFY_KEY` - Your Spotify application key (a.k.a Client ID).\\n* `SPOTIFY_SECRET` - Your Spotify application secret (a.k.a Client Secret).\\n* `SPOTIFY_USERNAME` - Your Spotify username.\\n* `SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID` - Your playlist identifier.\\n* `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` - URI to redirect to once your user has allowed the application\\'s permissions.\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\nVisit your slackbox\\'s home page to authenticate yourself with Spotify and you should be all set!\\n'},\n",

Fetch a copy of this repository, either with git or [download the\\n   zip archive](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/archive/master.zip).\\n\\n2. Navigate to the folder where you fetched the repository (unzip if\\n   needed) and make sure the file called `spotify` is executable:\\n   ````\\n   cd shpotify\\n   chmod +x spotify\\n   ````\\n\\n3. Copy the file `spotify` to a convenient location in your `PATH`, or\\n   set your `PATH` to include the folder where the file is located.\\n\\n### Connecting to Spotify’s API\\n\\nshpotify needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by\\nname.

       "  'readme_contents': \"# Spotify to Apple Music\\nSome simple Python 3 scripts to help you into importing your existing Spotify library into Apple Music.  \\n**Work in progress !**\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n### 1. Export the Spotify songs to an CSV File\\nThe first step is getting the songs you want to import into Apple Music into a CSV file. The simplest way to do this is using [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html).  \\nIf you want to export you whole Spotify library, simply create a new playlist called *All* and drag your whole library into it using the Spotify desktop app. You can then export the playlist *All* using *Exportify*. Save the resulting file as *spotify.csv* in the same directory as the directory you cloned this repo into.\\n\\n### 2. Match the Spotify songs with their Apple Music identifier\\nIn order to add songs to our Apple Music library, we need their Apple Music identifier. Running `python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` will use the *spotify.csv* file to create a new file *itunes.csv* with each line consisting of the Apple Music identifier of a song in your Spotify library.\\n\\n### 3. Use an intercepting proxy to retrieve the Apple Music request headers\\nStart iTunes and [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com) (or another intercepting proxy you like). Make sure SSL Proxying is enabled and working correctly. Next, select a random song on Apple Music you don't have in your library yet, right click and choose 'Add to library'. If everything went well, you're now able to view all the request headers in Charles of a request to `https://ld-4.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZDaap.woa/daap/databases/1/cloud-add`. We're only interested in `Cookie`, `X-Dsid` and `X-Guid`. Copy the value of these header and paste them in the appropriate place  in `insert-songs.py` (line 29 and further).  \\nNext, run `python3 insert-songs.py` and go grab a coffee. You're songs are now being imported into Apple Music.\\n\\n\\n## Current issues\\n\\n### API limit rate\\nApple Music doesn't like it when we're adding a lot of songs in a small amount of time. If we do so, the API responds to all further request with `403 Too many requests`. After this, you're blocked from the API for an undetermined amount of time. We're currently trying to avoid this by waiting after each request. A delay of 30 seconds seems fine to import large libraries into Apple Music. If you're library is smaller, feel free to decrease the delay in `inserts-songs.py`.\\n\\n### Missing songs\\nThe script I'm using to retrieve the Apple Music identifier for a Spotify song is quite basic. It simply compares the title and artist to find out if a Spotify and Apple Music song match. Some songs don't have the exact same title (extraneous spacing for example) in both services. This results in the script failing to retrieve an identifier for some songs.\\n\\n### Terminal encoding\\nSome users are reporting errors like `UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\\\xd8' in ...` when running the scripts. The problem here is that Python is trying to convert UTF-8 characters to ASCII to print them to standard output. This can be solved by setting the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to `utf-8`.  \\nIn Bash, simply call the scripts like this: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 insert-songs.Py`\\n\"},\n",

By default spotify-ripper will encode to MP3 files, but includes the ability to rip to WAV, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, AAC, and MP4/M4A.\\n\\n**Note that stream ripping violates the libspotify\\'s ToS**\\n\\nLibspotify’s Deprecation\\n------------------------\\n**From Mopidy\\'s documentation**\\n\\n*Note that as of May 2015 libspotify is officially deprecated by Spotify and is no longer actively maintained.*\\n\\n*Note that as of Jan 2016 Spotify may no longer be issuing developer keys.*\\n\\n*Spotify has published newer libraries intended for Android and iOS development, as well as web APIs to access track metadata and manage playlists. Though, for making apps with Spotify playback capabilities, on any other platform than Android and iOS, there is currently no alternative to libspotify.*\\n\\n*libspotify has been the main way of integrating with Spotify since 2009, and is today a part of numerous open source projects and commercial applications, including many receivers and even cars. There’s no guarantees, but one can hope that the large deployment of libspotify means that the library will continue to work with the Spotify service for a long time into the future.*\\n\\nFeatures\\n--------\\n\\n-  real-time VBR or CBR ripping from Spotify PCM stream\\n\\n-  writes ID3v2/metadata tags (including album covers)\\n\\n-  rips files into the following directory structure: ``artist/album/artist - song.mp3`` by default or optionally into a user-specified structure (see `Format String`_ section below)\\n\\n-  option to skip or overwrite existing files\\n\\n-  accepts tracks, playlists, albums, and artist URIs\\n\\n-  search for tracks using Spotify queries\\n\\n-  options for interactive login (no password in shell history) and\\n   to relogin using previous credentials\\n\\n-  option to remove tracks from playlist after successful ripping\\n\\n-  globally installs ripper script using setup.py\\n\\n-  Python 2.7.x and 3.4.x compatible.  Python 3 will occasionally throw a ``NameError: name \\'_lock\\' is not defined`` exception at the end of the script due to an `upstream bug <https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify/issues/133>`__ in ``pyspotify``.\\n\\n-  use a config file to specify common command-line options\\n\\n-  helpful progress bar to gauge the time remaining until completion\\n\\n-  keep local files in sync with a Spotify playlist, m3u and wpl playlist file\\n\\n-  option to rip to ALAC, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``avconv`` dependency)\\n\\n-  option to rip to FLAC, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``flac`` dependency)\\n\\n-  option to rip to Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3 (requires extra ``vorbis-tools`` dependency)\\n\\n-  option to rip to Opus instead of MP3 (requires extra ``opus-tools`` dependency)\\n\\n-  option to rip to AAC instead of MP3 (requires extra ``faac`` dependency)\\n\\n-  option to rip to MP4/M4A instead of MP3 (requires compiling ``fdkaac``)\\n\\n-  option to replace output filenames\\n\\n-  option to normalize output filenames to NFKD (see http://unicode.org/faq/normalization.html)\\n\\n**Please note: Spotify’s highest quality setting is 320 kbps, so the benefit of ripping to a lossless format is to not double encode the audio data.

Otherwise, use your Spotify login/password.\\n\\nConfig File\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFor options that you want set on every run, you can use a config file named ``config.ini`` in the settings folder (defaults to ``~/.spotify-ripper``).  The options in the config file use the same name as the command line options with the exception that dashes are translated to ``snake_case``.  Any option specified in the command line will overwrite any setting in the config file.  Please put all options under a ``[main]`` section.\\n\\nHere is an example config file\\n\\n.. code:: ini\\n\\n    [main]\\n    ascii = True\\n    format = {album_artist}/{album}/{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}\\n    quality = 160\\n    vorbis = True\\n    last = True\\n\\nFormat String\\n-------------\\n\\nThe format string dictates how ``spotify-ripper`` will organize your ripped files.  This is controlled through the ``-f | --format`` option.  The string should include the format of the file name and optionally a directory structure.   If you do not include a format string, the default format will be used: ``{album_artist}/{album}/{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``.\\n\\nThe ``--flat`` option is shorthand for using the format string: ``{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``, and the ``--flat-with-index`` option is shorthand for using the format string: ``{idx:3} - {artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``.  The use of these shorthand options will override any ``--format`` string option given.\\n\\nYour format string can include the following variables names, which are case-sensitive and wrapped in curly braces, if you want your file/path name to be overwritten with Spotify metadata.\\n\\nFormat String Variables\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\\n| Names and Aliases                       | Description                                   |\\n+=========================================+===============================================+\\n| ``{track_artist}``, ``{artist}``        | The track\\'s artist                            |\\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\\n| ``{track_artists}``, ``{artists}``      | Similar to ``{track_artist}`` but will be join|\\n|                                         | multiple artists with a comma                 |\\n|                                         | (e.g. \"artist 1, artist 2\")                   |\\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\\n| ``{album_artist}``                      | When passing an album, the album\\'s artist     |\\n|                                         | (e.g. \"Various Artists\").

For example, ``{idx:3}`` will produce the following output: 001, 002, 003, etc.  If no number is provided, no zero-filled padding will occur (e.g. 8, 9, 10, 11, ...). The variables that accept this option include ``{idx}``, ``{track_num}``, ``{disc_num}``, ``{smart_track_num}`` and their aliases.\\n\\nPrefix String\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFormat variable ``feat_artists`` takes a prefix string to be prepended before the output.  For example, ``{feat_artists:featuring} will produce the follow output ``featuing Bruno Mars``.  If there are no featuring artists, the prefix string (and any preceding spaces) will not be included.\\n\\nPlaylist Sync Option\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBy default, other than checking for an overwrite, ``spotify-ripper`` will not keep track of local files once they are ripped from Spotify.  However, if you use the ``--playlist-sync`` option when passing a playlist URI, ``spotify-ripper`` will store a json file in your settings directory that keeps track of location of your ripped files for that playlist.\\n\\nIf at a later time, the playlist is changed on Spotify (i.e. songs reordered, removed or added), ``spotify-ripper`` will try to keep your local files \"in sync\" the playlist if you rerun the same command.  For example, if your format string is ``{index} {artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``, it will rename is existing files so the index is correct.  Note that with option set, ``spotify-ripper`` will delete a song that was previously on the playlist, but was removed but still exists on your local machine.  It does not affect files outside of the playlist and has no effect on non-playlist URIs.\\n\\nIf you want to redownload a playlist (for example with improved quality), you either need to remove the song files from your local or use the ``--overwrite`` option.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n-  `libspotify <https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify>`__\\n\\n-  `pyspotify <https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify>`__\\n\\n-  a Spotify binary `app\\n   key <https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/>`__\\n   (spotify\\\\_appkey.key)\\n\\n-  `lame <http://lame.sourceforge.net>`__\\n\\n-  `mutagen <https://mutagen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__\\n\\n-  `colorama <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama>`__\\n\\n-  (optional) `flac <https://xiph.org/flac/index.html>`__\\n\\n-  (optional) `opus-tools <http://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/>`__\\n\\n-  (optional) `vorbis-tools <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/>`__\\n\\n-  (optional) `faac <http://www.audiocoding.com/downloads.html>`__\\n\\n-  (optional) `fdkaac <https://github.com/nu774/fdkaac>`__\\n\\nMac OS X\\n~~~~~~~~\\n\\nRecommend approach uses `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ and\\n`pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__\\n\\nTo install pyenv using homebrew:\\n\\n.. code:: bash\\n\\n    $ brew update\\n    $ brew install pyenv\\n    $ eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\\n    ## the next line ensures \\'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\\' is run everytime terminal is opened\\n    $ echo \\'if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"; fi\\' >> ~/.bash_profile\\n    $ pyenv install 2.7.10  # or whatever version of python you want\\n    $ pyenv global 2.7.10\\n    $ python -V             # should say Python 2.7.10\\n\\nTo install spotify-ripper once pyenv is setup:\\n\\n.. code:: bash\\n\\n    $ brew install homebrew/binary/libspotify\\n    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify.12.1.51.dylib \\\\\\n        /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify\\n    $ brew install lame\\n    $ git clone https://github.com/hbashton/spotify-ripper.git && cd spotify-ripper && sudo python setup.py install\\n    $ pyenv rehash\\n\\n**Note that Spotify may no longer be issuing developer keys.** See `Libspotify’s Deprecation`_\\n\\nDownload an application key file ``spotify_appkey.key`` from\\n``https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/`` (requires a Spotify\\nPremium Account) and move the file to the ``~/.spotify-ripper`` directory (or use\\nthe ``-k | --key`` option).\\n\\nUbuntu/Debian\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nRecommend approach uses `pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kaaes/spotify-web-api-android.git`\\n2. Build: `./gradlew assemble`\\n3. Grab the `aar` that can be found in `spotify-api/build/outputs/aar/spotify-web-api-android-0.4.1.aar`\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nOut of the box it uses [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) HTTP client and a [single thread executor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html).\\n\\n```java\\nSpotifyApi api = new SpotifyApi();\\n\\n// Most (but not all) of the Spotify Web API endpoints require authorisation.\\n// If you know you\\'ll only use the ones that don\\'t require authorisation you can skip this step\\napi.setAccessToken(\"myAccessToken\");\\n\\nSpotifyService spotify = api.getService();\\n\\nspotify.getAlbum(\"2dIGnmEIy1WZIcZCFSj6i8\", new Callback<Album>() {\\n    @Override\\n    public void success(Album album, Response response) {\\n        Log.d(\"Album success\", album.name);\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public void failure(RetrofitError error) {\\n        Log.d(\"Album failure\", error.toString());\\n    }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIt is also possible to construct the adapter with custom parameters.\\n\\n```java\\nfinal String accessToken = \"myAccessToken\";\\n\\nRestAdapter restAdapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()\\n        .setEndpoint(SpotifyApi.SPOTIFY_WEB_API_ENDPOINT)\\n        .setRequestInterceptor(new RequestInterceptor() {\\n            @Override\\n            public void intercept(RequestFacade request) {\\n                request.addHeader(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \" + accessToken);\\n            }\\n        })\\n        .build();\\n\\nSpotifyService spotify = restAdapter.create(SpotifyService.class);\\n```\\n\\n## Obtaining Access Tokens\\n\\nThe most straightforward way to get the access token is to use the Authentication Library from the [Spotify Android SDK](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk).\\nDetailed information how to use it can be found in the [Spotify Android SDK Authentication Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/android-sdk-authentication-guide/).\\n\\nFeeling adventurous? You can implement the auth flow yourself, following the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).\\n\\n\\n## Error Handling\\n\\nWhen using Retrofit, errors are returned as [`RetrofitError`](http://square.github.io/retrofit/javadoc/retrofit/RetrofitError.html)\\nobjects. These objects, among others, contain HTTP status codes and their descriptions,\\nfor example `400 - Bad Request`.\\nIn many cases this will work well enough but in some cases Spotify Web API returns more detailed information,\\nfor example `400 - No search query`.\\n\\nTo use the data returned in the response from the Web API `SpotifyCallback` object should be passed to the\\nrequest method instead of regular Retrofit\\'s `Callback`:\\n```java\\nspotify.getMySavedTracks(new SpotifyCallback<Pager<SavedTrack>>() {\\n    @Override\\n    public void success(Pager<SavedTrack> savedTrackPager, Response response) {\\n        // handle successful response\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public void failure(SpotifyError error) {\\n        // handle error\\n    }\\n});\\n```\\nFor synchronous requests `RetrofitError` can be converted to `SpotifyError` if needed:\\n```java\\ntry {\\n    Pager<SavedTrack> mySavedTracks = spotify.getMySavedTracks();\\n} catch (RetrofitError error) {\\n    SpotifyError spotifyError = SpotifyError.fromRetrofitError(error);\\n    // handle error\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Help\\n\\n#### Versioning policy\\nWe use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) as our versioning policy.\\n\\n#### Bugs, Feature requests\\nFound a bug?

However, to use this library to its full extent\\nyou will need to learn how to use the Ruby FFI API.\\n\\nThe Spotify gem has:\\n\\n- [100% API coverage][], including callback support. You’ll be able to use any function from the libspotify library.\\n- [Automatic garbage collection][]. Piggybacking on Ruby’s GC to manage pointer lifecycle.\\n- [Parallell function call protection][]. libspotify is not thread-safe, but Spotify protects you by making all API calls in a specific background thread.\\n- [Type conversion and type safety][]. Special pointers for every Spotify type, protecting you from accidental mix-ups.\\n- [Support for Ruby, JRuby and Rubinius][]. Thanks to FFI, the gem runs fine on the main three Ruby implementations!\\n\\n[100% API coverage]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API\\n[Automatic garbage collection]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/ManagedPointer\\n[Parallell function call protection]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify#method_missing-class_method\\n[Type conversion and type safety]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/ManagedPointer\\n[Support for Ruby, JRuby and Rubinius]: https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/blob/master/.travis.yml\\n\\nContact details\\n---------------\\n\\n- __Got questions?__ Ask on the mailing list: [ruby-spotify@googlegroups.com][] (<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ruby-spotify>)\\n- __Found a bug?__ Report an issue: <https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/issues/new>\\n- __Have feedback?__ I ❤ feedback! Please send it to the mailing list.\\n\\nQuestions, notes and answers\\n----------------------------\\n\\n### Links to keep close at hand when using libspotify\\n\\n- [spotify gem API reference](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API) — YARDoc reference for the spotify gem, maps to the [libspotify function list](https://developer.spotify.com/docs/libspotify/12.1.51/api_8h.html).\\n- [libspotify C API reference](https://developer.spotify.com/docs/libspotify/12.1.51/) — the one true source of documentation.\\n- [libspotify FAQ](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/faq/) — you should read this at least once.\\n- [spotify gem examples](https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/tree/master/examples) — located in the spotify gem repository.\\n- [spotify gem FAQ](#questions-notes-and-answers) — this README section.\\n\\n\\n### How to run the examples\\n\\nYou’ll need:\\n\\n1. Your [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) premium account credentials. If you sign in with Facebook, you’ll need your Facebook account e-mail and password.\\n2. Your [Spotify application key](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/keys/). Download the binary key, and put it in the `examples/` directory.\\n\\nRunning the examples is as simple as:\\n\\n```\\nruby example-audio_stream.rb\\n```\\n\\nAvailable examples are:\\n\\n- **example-audio_stream.rb**: plays songs from Spotify with the [plaything](https://github.com/Burgestrand/plaything) gem, using OpenAL.\\n- **example-console.rb**: logs in to Spotfify, and initiates a pry session to allow experimentation with the spotify gem API.\\n- **example-listing_playlists.rb**: list all playlists available for a certain user.\\n- **example-loading_object.rb**: loads a track using polling and the spotify gem API.\\n- **example-random_related_artists.rb**: looks up an artist and its similar artists on spotify, then it picks a similar artist at random and does the same to that artist, over and over. I have used this example file to test prolonged usage of the API.\\n\\n### Creating a Session, the first thing you should do\\n\\nAlmost all functions require you to have created a session before calling them. Forgetting to do so won’t work at best, and will segfault at worst. You\\'ll also want to log in before doing things as well, or objects will never load.\\n\\nSee [Spotify::API#session_create](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_create-instance_method) for how to create a session.\\nSee [Spotify::API#session_login](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_login-instance_method) for logging in.\\n\\n### libspotify is an asynchronous library\\n\\nWhen creating objects in libspotify they are not populated with data instantly, instead libspotify schedules them for download from the Spotify backend. For libspotify to do it\\'s work with downloading content, you need to call [Spotify::API#session_process_events](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_process_events-instance_method) regularly.\\n\\n### Facebook vs Spotify Classic\\n\\nUsers who signed up to Spotify with their Facebook account will have numeric IDs as usernames, so a link to their profile looks like [spotify:user:11101648092](spotify:user:11101648092). Spotify Classic users instead have their usernames as canonical name, so a link to their profile looks like [spotify:user:burgestrand](spotify:user:burgestrand).\\n\\nThis matters, for example, when you use the function [Spotify::API#session_publishedcontainer_for_user_create](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_publishedcontainer_for_user_create-instance_method).\\n\\n### Callbacks can be dangerous\\n\\nlibspotify allows you to pass callbacks that will be invoked by libspotify when events of interest occur, such as being logged out, or receiving audio data when playing a track.\\n\\nCallbacks can be very tricky. They must never be garbage collected while they are in use by libspotify, or you may get very weird bugs with your Ruby interpreter randomly crashing. Do use them, but be careful.\\n\\n### Opinions and the Spotify gem\\n\\nThe Spotify gem has very few opinions. It is build to closely resemble the libspotify C API, and has very little\\nto aid you in terms of how to structure your application. It aims to make calling the libspotify C API frictionless,\\nbut not much more. It is up to you to decide your own path.\\n\\n### A note about gem versioning\\n\\nGiven a version `X.Y.Z`, each segment corresponds to:\\n\\n- `X` reflects supported libspotify version (12.1.45 => 12). There are __no guarantees__ of backwards-compatibility!\\n- `Y` is for backwards-**incompatible** changes.\\n- `Z` is for backwards-**compatible** changes.\\n\\nYou should use the following version constraint: `gem \"spotify\", \"~> 12.5.3\"`.\\n\\n\\n### Manually installing libspotify\\n\\nBy default, Spotify uses [the libspotify gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/libspotify) which means you do\\nnot need to install libspotify yourself. However, if your platform is not supported by the libspotify\\ngem you will need to install libspotify yourself.\\n\\nPlease note, that if your platform is not supported by the libspotify gem I’d very much appreciate it\\nif you could create an issue on [libspotify gem issue tracker](https://github.com/Burgestrand/libspotify/issues)\\nso I can fix the build for your platform.\\n\\nInstructions on installing libspotify manually are in the wiki: [How to install libspotify](https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/wiki)\\n\\n[semantic versioning (semver.org)]: http://semver.org/\\n[ruby-spotify@googlegroups.com]: mailto:ruby-spotify@googlegroups.com\\n[libspotify]: https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/\\n[Spotify]: https://www.spotify.com/\\n[Hallon]: https://github.com/Burgestrand/Hallon\\n'},\n",

You may also see an interface to modify the shortcuts on different versions of vscode.\\n\\nExample :\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\\t\"command\": \"spotify.volumeDown\",\\n\\t\\t\"key\": \"cmd+shift+g\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor more info on hotkeys please look at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings\\n\\n## Buttons\\nThis extension provides a variety of buttons to control Spotify from status bar. By default 4 buttons are enabled:\\n1. Previous track\\n2. Play / Pause\\n3. Next track\\n4. Mute / Unmute\\n\\nYou can modify the shown buttons by changing your parameters ([go here to find out how](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userandworkspace)):\\n```json\\n\"spotify.showNextButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": true,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show next button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showPreviousButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": true,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show previous button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showPlayButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show play button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showPauseButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show pause button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showPlayPauseButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": true,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show play|pause button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showMuteVolumeButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show mute button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showUnmuteVolumeButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show unmute button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showMuteUnmuteVolumeButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": true,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show mute|unmute button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showVolumeUpButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show volume up button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showVolumeDownButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show volume down button.\"\\n}\\n\"spotify.showToggleRepeatingButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show toggle repeating button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.showToggleShufflingButton\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\n\\t\"default\": false,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show toggle shuffling button.\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor the full configuration options go [here](https://github.com/ShyykoSerhiy/vscode-spotify/blob/master/package.json#L161).\\n\\nNote that due to limitations of Spotify\\'s Applescript API ```toggleRepeatingButton``` toggles only\\n\\'repeat all\\' property of spotify. There is no way to set \\'repeat one\\' via vscode-spotify.  \\n\\nYou can also change the position of buttons by changing the parameters below:\\n\\n```json\\n\"spotify.priorityBase\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 30,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Base value of priority for all vscode-spotify elements in Status Bar(priority = basePriority+priority). This is done to avoid \\'conflicts\\' with other extensions. \"\\n},\\n\"spotify.nextButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 8,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of next button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.previousButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 10,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of previous button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.playButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 7,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of play button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.pauseButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 6,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of pause button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.playPauseButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 9,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of play|pause button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.muteButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 5,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of mute button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.unmuteButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 4,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of unmute button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.muteUnmuteButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 3,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of mute|unmute button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.volumeUpButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 2,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of volume up button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.volumeDownButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 1,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of volume down button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.trackInfoPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 0,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of volume track info.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.toggleRepeatingButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 11,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of toggle repeating button.\"\\n},\\n\"spotify.toggleShufflingButtonPriority\": {\\n\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\n\\t\"default\": 12,\\n\\t\"description\": \"Priority of toggle shuffling button.\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Seeking to a specific point in a song\\nYou can use `Spotify Seek To` command (`spotify.seekTo`) to seek to the specific point in a song. You can specify hotkey that will seek to a custom time in a song by adding keybinding in keybindings.json. For example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"command\": \"spotify.seekTo\",\\n    \"key\": \"alt+d\",\\n    \"args\": \"1:15\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n[MIT LICENSE](LICENSE)\\n'},\n",

Just log in and it will traverse your playlists, finding songs that appear multiple times with the same identifier (Spotify URI) in a given playlist.\\n\\nIf it finds duplicates, they can be removed just pushing a button. And since it doesn't create a whole new playlist, it keeps all the information like creation date and subscribers.\\n\\n## Try it\\n\\nYou can check it out on [https://spotify-dedup.com](https://spotify-dedup.com) or run it locally.\\n\\n## Install and run\\n\\nInstall the dependencies:\\n\\n    yarn install\\n\\nRun it:\\n\\n    yarn dev\\n\\nThen open http://localhost:3000 in a browser\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nIn order to test saved tracks, create duplicated tracks by executing the Web API request on https://developer.spotify.com/console/put-current-user-saved-tracks/?ids=2JZfTvWWtpaE8NohqRXqFr,1poUtf2dDdVUtWL8tn03Wd,6ADSaE87h8Y3lccZlBJdXH,2x45xqISlmmDJqxOqr8BuS,1iQ1BpOGF1Umd3lpTV4OPO.\\n\\n## About the tools used and implementation details\\n\\n### Spotify Web API and Promises\\n\\nThis app is a good example of how to traverse a user's library without incurring in rate limit.

Create a new application on heroku\\n4. fork this repository\\n  * To deploy bot on heroku there are two methods (CLI and Web), we use the heroku.com way:\\n5. In your application on heroku go to deploy tab and choose Github on deployment method\\n6. Select this repository you forked there and choose deploy from master option\\n7. Then go to settings tab on heroku and add two vars to config vars:\\n  - URL: Base URL of the application you created on Heroku\\n  - TOKEN: your telegram bot token)\\n8. install [heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) and run the command `heroku stack:set container -a APP_NAME` (APP_NAME is name of the app you choose when creating heroku application) then login to your account for change to happen\\n9. In heroku from deploy section scroll down to Manual deploy and press deploy branch for master branch\\n\\n## Setup everywhere else\\n1. use the Dockerfile for deployment method\\n2. Set the TOKEN and URL in environment variables\\n\\n## Local Development\\nTo run the bot on local machine you need a way to expose a web url from your machine, this can be done with tools like [ngrok.io](https://ngrok.com).\\nAfter setting up the URL run the bot and provide the settings\\n```python\\npython bot.py --token {your-token} --url {ngrok-url} --port 8443\\n```\\n'},\n",

By automatically batching\\nAPI requests, it allows you to enter an artist’s name and retrieve their\\nentire discography in seconds, along with Spotify’s audio features and\\ntrack/album popularity metrics. You can also pull song and playlist\\ninformation for a given Spotify User (including yourself!).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nCRAN version 2.2.3 (recommended)\\n\\n``` r\\ninstall.packages(\\'spotifyr\\')\\n```\\n\\nDevelopment version\\n\\n``` r\\ndevtools::install_github(\\'charlie86/spotifyr\\')\\n```\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nFirst, set up a Dev account with Spotify to access their Web API\\n[here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).\\nThis will give you your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Once you have\\nthose, you can pull your access token into R with\\n`get_spotify_access_token()`.\\n\\nThe easiest way to authenticate is to set your credentials to the System\\nEnvironment variables `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.\\nThe default arguments to `get_spotify_access_token()` (and all other\\nfunctions in this package) will refer to those. Alternatively, you can\\nset them manually and make sure to explicitly refer to your access token\\nin each subsequent function call.\\n\\n``` r\\nSys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = \\'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\')\\nSys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = \\'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\')\\n\\naccess_token <- get_spotify_access_token()\\n```\\n\\n#### Authorization Code Flow\\n\\nFor certain functions and applications, you’ll need to log in as a\\nSpotify user. To do this, your Spotify Developer application needs to\\nhave a callback url. You can set this to whatever you want that will\\nwork with your application, but a good default option is\\n`http://localhost:1410/` (see image below).

The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts\\nthese credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as `options`\\nspecifying a client ID, client secret, and callback URL.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst SpotifyStrategy = require('passport-spotify').Strategy;\\n\\npassport.use(\\n  new SpotifyStrategy(\\n    {\\n      clientID: client_id,\\n      clientSecret: client_secret,\\n      callbackURL: 'http://localhost:8888/auth/spotify/callback',\\n    },\\n    function (accessToken, refreshToken, expires_in, profile, done) {\\n      User.findOrCreate({spotifyId: profile.id}, function (err, user) {\\n        return done(err, user);\\n      });\\n    }\\n  )\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Authenticate Requests\\n\\nUse `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'spotify'` strategy, to\\nauthenticate requests.\\n\\nFor example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)\\napplication:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.get('/auth/spotify', passport.authenticate('spotify'));\\n\\napp.get(\\n  '/auth/spotify/callback',\\n  passport.authenticate('spotify', {failureRedirect: '/login'}),\\n  function (req, res) {\\n    // Successful authentication, redirect home.\\n    res.redirect('/');\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Using scopes\\n\\nDepending on the data you want to fetch, you may want to specify custom scopes. For more information about scopes in the Spotify Web API check [their developer site](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/).\\n\\nBy default, no scope is passed. That means that you won't fetch information such as display name, picture or email. You can get those by using these scopes:\\n\\n- `user-read-email`: Returns the email address of the user on Spotify, if it exists.\\n- `user-read-private`: Returns private information about the user such as display name and picture, if they are set.\\n\\nYou can specify the parameters in the `authenticate` call:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.get(\\n  '/auth/spotify',\\n  passport.authenticate('spotify', {\\n    scope: ['user-read-email', 'user-read-private'],\\n  })\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Forcing login dialog\\n\\nYou can force the login dialog using the `showDialog` parameter when authenticating:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.get(\\n  '/auth/spotify',\\n  passport.authenticate('spotify', {\\n    scope: ['user-read-email', 'user-read-private'],\\n    showDialog: true,\\n  })\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nFor a complete, working example, refer to the [login example](https://github.com/jmperez/passport-spotify/tree/master/examples/login).\\n\\nYou can get your keys on [Spotify - My Applications](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications).\\n\\n## Tests\\n\\n    $ npm install --dev\\n    $ npm test\\n\\n## Build and Coverage Status\\n\\n[![Actions Status](https://github.com/JMPerez/passport-spotify/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JMPerez/passport-spotify/actions)\\n\\n## License\\n\\n[The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\\n\"},\n",

Well, with this killer project, now you can!\\n\\n**This is for testing purposes ONLY!** Spotify is a fantastic service and worth every penny. This script is **NOT** meant to circumvent buying premium! Please do consider switching to premium to support Spotify - especially if you\\'re going to use it on mobile. If the script does not work for you, help us improve it!\\n\\n### Dependencies\\n\\nUtilities used in the script:\\n\\n  - xprop\\n  - pacmd\\n  - notify-send\\n  - **xdotool**\\n\\nNew dependencies are highlighted in bold. Please make sure to install these before upgrading the script.\\n\\nYou will also need to have one of the following audio/media players installed:\\n\\n  - mpv\\n  - vlc\\n  - mplayer\\n  - mpg321\\n  - avplay\\n  - ffplay\\n\\nPlease consult the Settings section below for information on setting a custom audio player.\\n\\n[![openSUSE](https://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/468x60.png)](http://www.opensuse.org/)\\n\\nInstall all utilities + VLC on **[openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/)** with:\\n\\n    sudo zypper in binutils pulseaudio-utils libnotify-tools xdotool vlc\\n\\n[![Ubuntu](http://spreadubuntu.neomenlo.org/files/banner-468x60.png)](http://www.ubuntu.com/)\\n\\nInstall all utilities + VLC on **[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)** with:\\n\\n    sudo apt-get install x11-utils pulseaudio-utils libnotify-bin xdotool vlc\\n\\n[![Arch Linux](http://www.faderweb.de/img/archlinux.jpg)](http://www.archlinux.org/)\\n\\nThere is an [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spotify-adkiller-git/) for  **[Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/)**. To install:\\n\\n    git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/spotify-adkiller-git.git\\n    cd spotify-adkiller-git\\n    makepkg -si\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\n**Automated Installation**\\n\\nGrab the latest release of `Spotify-AdKiller`:\\n\\n    git clone https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller.git\\n\\nRun the provided installer:\\n\\n    cd Spotify-AdKiller\\n    ./install.sh\\n\\n**Troubleshooting**\\n\\n- `Spotify-AdKiller` has been tested to work with Spotify 0.9.x. Support for the 1.0.x beta releases has been implemented, but still needs more testing. If you run into any bugs while using `Spotify-AdKiller` with a Spotify beta release please report them on the bug tracker.\\n\\n- If you\\'ve installed Spotify from any source other than the official repository please make sure that the `spotify` executable is in your `PATH`.\\n\\n    You can create a symbolic link, if necessary (e.g. linking `my-spotify` to `spotify` if you are using the user installation of [spotify-make](https://github.com/leamas/spotify-make)).\\n\\n- The installer script will install `Spotify-AdKiller` to `$HOME/bin`, which should be recognized by Ubuntu and openSUSE.\\n\\n- If `$HOME/bin` didn\\'t exist before, a relog might be necessary to complete the installation.\\n\\n    Technical explanation: Ubuntu automatically adds `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` if it exists when you log in. Relogging reloads `$HOME/.profile` and updates your `PATH`.\\n\\n    If the script doesn\\'t work after relogging you can either [manually add](http://askubuntu.com/q/3744) `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` or follow the installation instructions below. This also applies if you\\'re using a distro that is configured differently than Ubuntu/OpenSUSE or if you want to install the script in a custom location.\\n\\n- If GUI and text are too small, you can scale the application by editing the desktop file:\\n\\n        cd /home/<your username>/.local/share/applications\\n        sudo gedit Spotify\\\\ \\\\(AdKiller\\\\).desktop\\n\\n    Add `--force-device-scale-factor=2` to scale it with factor 2:\\n\\n        Exec=spotify-wrapper.sh --force-device-scale-factor=2 %U\\n\\n**Manual Installation**\\n\\n1. Copy `spotify-adkiller.sh` and `spotify-wrapper.sh` to your `PATH` (e.g. `$HOME/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on openSUSE and Ubuntu) and make both of them executable with `chmod +x spotify-adkiller.sh` and `chmod +x spotify-wrapper.sh`.\\n\\n2. Copy `Spotify (AdKiller).desktop` to `$HOME/.local/share/applications` or any other folder your distro reads `.desktop` launchers from (e.g. `/usr/share/applications`, `/usr/local/share/applications`).\\n\\nThe default configuration file will be written automatically on the first startup of the script.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nIf you installed `Spotify-AdKiller` correctly, a new entry called `Spotify (AdKiller)` should appear in your menu. This launcher will start Spotify in ad-free mode. The script will terminate automatically as soon as Spotify exits. As mentioned before, **this is for testing purposes ONLY** so use this new entry only when your purposes are **testing**.\\n\\n**Important note:** Please make sure you don\\'t have notifications disabled in your Spotify configuration (`ui.track_notifications_enabled=true` in `~/.config/spotify/User/<your username>/prefs`).\\n\\n### Settings\\n\\nThe configuration file for `Spotify-AdKiller` is located under `$HOME/.config/Spotify-AdKiller/Spotify-AdKiller.cfg`. There are several settings that control how `Spotify-AdKiller` operates:\\n\\n**Modes**\\n\\n`CUSTOM_MODE` controls the ad blocking mode. The following modes are available:\\n\\n- `simple`: mute Spotify, unmute when ad is over\\n- `interstitial`: mute Spotify, play random local track, stop and unmute when ad is over\\n    + If the local track is shorter than the ad, `Spotify-AdKiller` will automatically try to loop it. This will only work with players that support a loop option. If you are planning to use this feature with a custom player make sure to also supply a custom loop option in your configuration file.\\n- `continuous`: mute Spotify, play random local track, stop and unmute when track is over\\n    + You can skip the local track as soon as the ad is over. To do so, simply press Play or Forward/Next in your Spotify client (or use the corresponding hotkeys).\\n    + Please note that the `continuous` ad blocking mode works best with tracks that are longer than the average ad duration (≈30-45s). If a custom track ends prematurely or is shorter than the current ad, `Spotify-AdKiller` will switch to the next random local track in line.\\n\\nThe default ad blocking mode is `continuous`.\\n\\n`Spotify-AdKiller` will always fall back to `simple` mode if no local tracks are found and/or if no supported music player is available on the system.\\n\\n**Local Playback**\\n\\nThe following settings control local music playback during ads:\\n\\n- `CUSTOM_PLAYER`: local music player to use; chosen automatically by default\\n- `CUSTOM_LOOPOPT`: loop option for custom player (e.g. `-loop 0`); we recommend setting this if you are planning to use interstitial adblocking mode\\n- `CUSTOM_VOLUME`: volume of local playback; set to 100 by default\\n- `CUSTOM_MUSIC`: local track to play / local music directory to choose tracks from; set to XDG standard music directory by default (e.g. `$HOME/Music`)\\n\\n**Debug Setting**\\n\\nYou can make the CLI output more verbose and enable the log file by setting `DEBUG` to `1`. The log will be written to `$HOME/.Spotify-AdKiller.log` and replaced each time `Spotify-AdKiller` runs.\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n\\nPlease make sure to always use the provided launcher when running Spotify. Under some circumstances Spotify might remain muted when exiting the application. This is a technical limitation with `PulseAudio`. `Spotify-AdKiller` automatically unmutes Spotify when initially run.\\n\\nIf, for some reason, Spotify does remain muted you can use the following command to unmute it manually while it\\'s running:\\n\\n```bash\\nfor i in $(LC_ALL=C pactl list | grep -E \\'(^Sink Input)|(media.name = \\\\\"Spotify\\\\\"$)\\' | cut -d \\\\# -f2 | grep -v Spotify); do pactl set-sink-input-mute \"$i\" no; done\\n```\\n\\n### Similar Projects\\n\\n- [blockify](https://github.com/mikar/blockify) - automatic/blacklist-based ad-blocker written in Python\\n- [spotify_ad_blocker_linux.rb](https://github.com/superr4y/hacks/blob/master/spotify/spotify_ad_blocker_linux.rb) - automatic ad-blocker written in Ruby\\n- [spotify-blacklist-mute](https://github.com/ysangkok/spotify-blacklist-mute) - blacklist-based muting, written in Bash\\n\\n### License\\n\\nMany people have contributed to make our script become what it is today (huge shout-out to the initial creator [pcworld](https://github.com/pcworld)).

This will allow saving your password securely between launches.\\n\\nIn GNOME, things should work out of the box. It might be a bit trickier to get it working in other DEs: see this [ArchWiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring) for detailed explanations on how to automatically start the daemon with your session.\\n\\nBear special attention to the fact that to enable automatic login, you might have to use the same password for your user account and for the keyring, and that the keyring might need to be [set as default](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Passwords_are_not_remembered).\\n\\nSee [this comment](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/92#issuecomment-801852593) for more details!\\n\\n### Login in with Facebook\\n\\n...is not supported. However, you can update your account in order to be able to log in with a username and password [as explained in this issue](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/373).\\n\\n\\n### Settings\\n\\nSpot can also be configured via `gsettings` if you want to change the audio backend, the song bitrate, etc. [A GUI is planned but not available yet.](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/142)\\n\\n### Seek bar warping\\nIt is possible to click on the seek bar to navigate to that position in a song. If you are having issues with this not working you may have [gtk-primary-button-warps-slider](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/property.Settings.gtk-primary-button-warps-slider.html) set to false.\\nIn order to fix this issue set the value to true in your gtk configuration.\\n\\n### Scrobbling\\n\\nScrobbling is not supported directly by Spot. However, you can use a tool such a [rescrobbled](https://github.com/InputUsername/rescrobbled) ([see #85](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/85)).\\n\\n### Lyrics\\n\\nSimilarly, Spot does not display lyrics for songs, but you can use [osdlyrics](https://github.com/osdlyrics/osdlyrics)  ([see #226](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/226)).\\n\\n### Gtk theme\\n\\nSpot uses the dark theme variant by default; this can be changed using `gsettings`.\\n\\nIf you are using the flatpak version, don\\'t forget to install your theme with flatpak as well. See [this comment](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/209#issuecomment-860180537) for details.\\n\\nSimilarly, snap also requires that you install the corresponding snap for your theme. See [this comment](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/338#issuecomment-975543476) for details.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n**Only works with premium accounts!**\\n\\n- playback control (play/pause, prev/next, seeking, shuffle, repeat (none, all, song))\\n- selection mode: easily browse and select mutliple tracks to queue them\\n- browse your saved albums and playlists\\n- search albums and artists\\n- view an artist\\'s releases\\n- view users\\' playlists\\n- view album info\\n- credentials management with Secret Service\\n- MPRIS integration\\n\\n### Planned\\n\\n- playlist management (creation and edition)\\n- liked tracks\\n- GNOME search provider?\\n- improved search? (track results)\\n- recommendations?\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nContributions are welcome! If you wish, add yourself to the `AUTHORS` files when submitting your contribution.\\n\\nFor any large feature/change, please consider opening an issue first to discuss implementation and design decisions.\\n\\n### Translating\\n\\nTranslations are managed using `gettext` and are available in the `po/` subdirectory.\\n\\n**I am now experimenting an online service, [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=xfVrpQfRBM), to manage translations; PRs are still welcome if you feel like using these instead!**\\n\\nIf you feel like it, you are welcome to open a PR to be added to the `TRANSLATORS` file!\\n\\n## Building\\n\\n### With GNOME Builder and flatpak\\n\\nPre-requisite: install the `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable` SDK extension with flatpak. Builder might do this for you automatically, but it will install an older version; make sure  the version installed matches the version of the Freedesktop SDK GNOME uses.\\n\\nOpen the project in GNOME Builder and make the `dev.alextren.Spot.development.json` configuration active. Then build :)\\n\\n### Manually\\n\\nRequires Rust (stable), **GTK4**, and a couple other things. Also requires **libadwaita**: it is not packaged on all distros at the moment, you might have to build it yourself!\\n\\nWith meson:\\n\\n```\\nmeson target -Dbuildtype=debug -Doffline=false --prefix=\"$HOME/.local\"\\nninja install -C target\\n```\\n\\nThis will install a `.desktop` file among other things, and the spot executable will be put in `.local/bin` (you might want to add it to your path).\\n\\nTo build an optimized release build, use `-Dbuildtype=release` instead.\\n\\n### Regenerating potfiles\\n\\nWhen adding new `msgids`, don\\'t forget to regenerate/update the potfiles.\\n\\n```\\nninja spot-pot -C target\\nninja spot-update-po -C target\\n```\\n\\n### Pulling updated strings from POEditor\\n\\nWe are now using POEditor and the wonderful [`poeditor-sync`](https://github.com/mick88/poeditor-sync) tool.\\n\\n```\\npoeditor pull\\n```\\n\\n### Regenerating sources for flatpak\\n\\nUsing [flatpak-cargo-generator.py](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/cargo):\\n\\n```\\nninja cargo-sources.json -C target\\n```\\n\\n### Debugging\\n\\nSet the `RUST_LOG` env variable to the appropriate level.\\n\\nDebug builds (flatpak) are available from the master branch on Github (see the `spot-snaphots` action).\\n\\nSpot caches images and HTTP responses in `~/.cache/spot`.\\n\\nSpot uses [isahc](https://github.com/sagebind/isahc), which uses libcurl, therefore you can set the `https_proxy` env variable to help with debugging. In debug mode, Spot skips SSL certificate verification.\\n'},\n",

Everything is meant to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.\\n\\nSince we are using the lite version of raspbian, some extra packages need to be installed:\\n\\n# Instructions\\n\\n1. Install updates \\n\\n```\\nsudo apt-get update \\nsudo apt-get upgrade\\n```\\n2. Install Required Packages.\\n\\nInstallation for python3-pip, raspotify, python3-tk, openbox\\n```\\n\\nsudo apt install python-setuptools python3-setuptools\\n\\nsudo apt install python3-pip\\n\\nsudo curl -sL https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/install.sh | sh\\n\\nsudo apt-get install python3-tk \\n\\nsudo apt-get install redis-server\\n\\nsudo apt-get install openbox\\n\\nsudo apt install xorg\\n\\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\\n\\nsudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils\\n\\n```\\n3. Install Dependencies\\n\\n```\\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n4. Install pi-btaudio\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/bablokb/pi-btaudio.git\\ncd pi-btaudio\\nsudo tools/install\\n```\\n5. Install PiGPIO\\n```\\nwget https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/archive/master.zip\\nunzip master.zip\\ncd pigpio-master\\nmake\\nsudo make install\\n```\\n\\n6. Setup Spotify API\\n\\nFirst Create an App at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications/\\n```\\nhttps://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1&scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-modify-playback-state%20user-read-currently-playing%20\\tapp-remote-control%20streaming%20playlist-modify-public%20playlist-modify-private%20playlist-read-private%20playlist-read-collaborative\\n```\\n\\n\\n7. raspi-config\\n\\n` sudo raspi-config`\\n\\n_Console Autologin_\\n\\n_Display Option -> Screen Blanking -> Off_ if you want to avoid the screen turning black after a few seconds.\\n\\n\\n8. bash_profile\\n\\nIn *.bash_profile* added the following (if the file is not htere, you must create it)\\n\\n```\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n[[ -z $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]] && startx -- -nocursor\\n\\n# Disable any form of screen saver / screen blanking / power management\\n\\nxset s off\\n\\nxset s noblank\\n```\\n\\n9. Configure xinitrc\\n\\n`sudo nano /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc`\\n\\n\\nInside, make sure the following is there:\\n```\\n#!/bin/sh\\n\\n# /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\\n\\n# global xinitrc file, used by all X sessions started by xinit (startx)\\n\\n# invoke global X session script\\n\\n#. /etc/X11/Xsession\\n\\nexec openbox-session #-> This is the one that launches Openbox ;)\\n```\\n10. Run \"spotifypod.py\" with autostart\\n\\n`sudo nano /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart`\\n\\n\\nand add the following command to launch spotifypod.py:\\n\\n```\\ncd /home/pi/fork/retro-ipod-spotify-client/frontend/\\n\\nsudo -H -u pi python3 spotifypod.py &\\n\\nsudo /home/pi/fork/retro-ipod-spotify-client/clickwheel/click &\\n```\\n\\n_Make sure that the paths are ok with your setup!!_\\n\\nin ` sudo nano /etc/xdg/openbox/environment` all the variables needed to run spotifypod.py are set( SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET,SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI)\\n\\n```\\nexport SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=\\'your_SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID\\'\\n\\nexport SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=\\'your_SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET\\'\\n\\nexport SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=\\'your_SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI\\'\\n```\\n\\n11. Synchronizing Spotify data!\\nLast but not least, if you want to make sure all your playlists artists, etc are synchronized every time you turn on your Spotypod, you can simply modify the script view_model.py with the following at line 16:\\n\\n`#spotify_manager.refresh_devices()`\\n\\n`spotify_manager.refresh_data()`\\n\\n\\ninstead of calling refresh_device, you can execute refresh_data. This will sync all your data and then will eceute refresh.devices. This will make the boot up way slower! but it will synchronize every single time you switch on :). \\nIf you dont run at least once `refresh_data()` no playlist, artist or anything related with your account will be displayed!\\n\\n12. Configure Raspotify\\n\\n`sudo nano /etc/default/raspotify`\\n\\n\\nUncomment and fill the following line:\\n\\n`OPTIONS=\"--username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>\"`\\n\\n\\nAnd maybe you want also to consider the following:\\n\\n```\\n# The displayed device type in Spotify clients. \\n\\n# Can be \"unknown\", \"computer\", \"tablet\", \"smartphone\", \"speaker\", \"tv\",\\n\\n# \"avr\" (Audio/Video Receiver), \"stb\" (Set-Top Box), and \"audiodongle\".\\n\\nDEVICE_TYPE=\"smartphone\"\\n```\\n\\n# Wiring\\n\\nHere is the wiring of the hardware, as of revision 1.

Go to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy**\\n2. Open the **Privacy** tab, and look for **Accessibility** in the left list\\n3. Turn on the checkbox for **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app** in the right list\\n2. Look for **Automation** in the left list\\n3.

This repository provides you with an easy installation on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/home). The current `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and `CLIENT_CALLBACK_URL` are straight from [Spotifys Repo](https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk/tree/master/Demo%20Projects) and work with their example apps. \\n\\n\\nSetup\\n=======\\n\\n* Sign up for [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) and follow the first two [Getting Started Steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#introduction)\\n\\nUnless you are expecting **massive** traffic, the free plan will work for you. Be patient, it can take up to 60 min until you get the confirmation Mail from Heroku.\\n\\n* [Clone](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#prepare-the-app) this Repository\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/simontaen/SpotifyTokenSwap.git\\ncd SpotifyTokenSwap\\n```\\n\\nFrom here on forward it\\'s basically following the Getting Started Guide.\\n\\n* [Deploy](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#deploy-the-app) the app using git\\n\\n```bash\\nheroku create --http-git\\ngit push heroku master\\nheroku ps:scale web=1\\n```\\n\\n* [View logs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#view-logs)\\n\\n```bash\\nheroku logs --tail\\n```\\n\\n* Verify its running\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl https://peaceful-sierra-1249.herokuapp.com\\n```\\n\\nand you should get a `<h1>Not Found</h1>` back. Also check the logs should show something like\\n\\n```\\napp[web.1]: ip-10-147-165-35.ec2.internal - - [<timestamp>] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 404 18\\napp[web.1]: - -> /\\napp[web.1]: <your-ip> - - [<timestamp>] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 404 18 0.0005\\nheroku[router]: at=info method=GET path=\"/\" host=peaceful-sierra-1249.herokuapp.com <...>\\n```\\n\\nOr run the Spotify examples with a corrected `kTokenSwapServiceURL` and `kTokenRefreshServiceURL`.\\n\\n* Your own app\\n\\nAs mentioned above the current code is configured to what Spotify provided us. So you need to syncronize the `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and `CLIENT_CALLBACK_URL` between your [Spotify Account](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications), your iOS App and the `spotify_token_swap.rb`.\\n\\n\\nRun Locally\\n=======\\n\\n```bash\\nbundle install\\nforeman start\\n```\\n\\n`foreman`is part of the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#set-up).\\n\\n\\nConvenience\\n=======\\n\\nI personally will host an instance on Heroku for public use as it is very annoying to go through setting everything up when you just want to try something with the SDK. I\\'ll keep it on the free plan and won\\'t pay much attention to it. We\\'ll see how it goes but if the service it getting slammed it\\'ll crash, so be polite.\\n\\n```\\nhttps://peaceful-sierra-1249.herokuapp.com/swap\\nhttps://peaceful-sierra-1249.herokuapp.com/refresh\\n```\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': '# polybar-spotify\\n\\nThis is a module that shows the current song playing and its primary artist on Spotify, with a Spotify-green underline, for people that don\\'t want to set up mpd. If Spotify is not active, nothing is shown. If the song name is longer than `trunclen` characers (default 25), it is truncated and `...` is appended. If the song is truncated and contains a single opening parenthesis, the closing paranethsis is appended as well.\\n\\n### Controls\\n\\nYou can add mouse controls for the player inside the module, as well. The configuration shown below uses mouse-1 for play-pause, mouse-2 for next, and mouse-3 for previous.\\n\\n### Dependencies\\n- Python (2.x or 3.x)\\n- Python [`dbus`](https://pypi.org/project/dbus-python/) module\\n- playerctl\\n\\n[![sample screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/kEluTSq.png)](https://i.imgur.com/kEluTSq.png)\\n\\n### Settings\\n``` ini\\n[module/spotify]\\ntype = custom/script\\ninterval = 1\\nformat-prefix = \"\\ue0ec \"\\nformat = <label>\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script -f \\'{artist}: {song}\\'\\nformat-underline = #1db954\\n;control players (optional)\\nclick-left = playerctl --player=spotify play-pause \\nclick-right = playerctl --player=spotify next \\nclick-middle = playerctl --player=spotify previous \\n```\\n\\n#### Custom arguments\\n\\n##### Truncate\\n\\nThe argument \"-t\" is optional and sets the `trunlen`. It specifies the maximum length of the printed string, so that it gets truncated when the specified length is exceeded. Defaults to 35.\\n\\nOverride example:\\n\\n``` ini\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script -t 42\\n```\\n\\n##### Format\\n\\nThe argument \"-f\" is optional and sets the format. You can specify how to display the song and the artist\\'s name, as well as where (or whether) to print the play-pause indicator. \\n\\nOverride example:\\n\\n``` ini\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script -f \\'{play_pause} {song} - {artist} - {album}\\'\\n```\\n\\nThis would output \"Lone Digger - Caravan Palace - <I°_°I>\" in your polybar, instead of what is shown in the screenshot.\\n\\n##### Status indicator\\n\\nThe argument \"-p\" is optional, and sets which unicode symbols to use for the status indicator. These should be given as a comma-separated string, with the play indicator as the first value and the pause indicator as the second.\\n\\nOverride example:\\n\\n``` ini\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script -p \\'[playing],[paused]\\'\\n```\\n\\n##### Fonts\\n\\nThe argument \"--font\" is optional, and allow to specify which font from your Polybar config to use to display the main label.\\n\\nOverride example:\\n```ini\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script --font=1\\n```\\n\\nThe argument \"--playpause-font\" is optional, and allow to specify which font from your Polybar config to use to display the \"play/pause\" indicator.\\n\\nOverride example:\\n``` ini\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script -p \\'[playing],[paused]\\' --playpause-font=2\\n```\\n\\n##### Quiet\\n\\nThe argument \"-q\" or \"--quiet\" is optional and specifies whether to display the output when the current song is paused.\\nThis will make polybar only show a song title and artist (or whatever your custom format is) when the song is actually playing and not when it\\'s paused.\\nSimply setting the flag on the comand line will enable this option.\\n\\nOverride example:\\n```ini\\nexec = python /path/to/spotify/script -q\\n```\\n'},\n",

I\\'m only doing bug fixes on this repo and I don\\'t really have a whole lot of time to update it. [react-native-spotify-remote](https://github.com/cjam/react-native-spotify-remote) is being worked on by someone else to use the newer \"remote\" SDK.\\n\\n## Install\\n\\nTo add the Spotify SDK to your project, cd into your project directory and run the following commands:\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save rn-spotify-sdk\\nreact-native link react-native-events\\nreact-native link rn-spotify-sdk\\n```\\n\\nNext, do the manual setup for each platform:\\n\\n#### iOS\\nManually add `SpotifyMetadata.framework` and `SpotifyAudioPlayback.framework` from `node_modules/rn-spotify-sdk/ios/external/SpotifySDK` to *Linked Frameworks and Libraries* in your project settings. Then add `../node_modules/rn-spotify-sdk/ios/external/SpotifySDK` to *Framework Search Paths* in your project settings.\\n\\n#### Android\\n\\nEdit `android/build.gradle` and add `flatDir`\\n\\n```\\n...\\nallprojects {\\n\\trepositories {\\n\\t\\tmavenLocal()\\n\\t\\tjcenter()\\n\\t\\tmaven {\\n\\t\\t\\t// All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm\\n\\t\\t\\turl \"$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tflatDir {\\n\\t\\t\\tdirs project(\\':rn-spotify-sdk\\').file(\\'libs\\'), \\'libs\\'\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n...\\n```\\n\\nEdit `android/app/build.gradle` and add `packagingOptions`\\n\\n```\\n...\\nbuildTypes {\\n    release {\\n        minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds\\n        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(\"proguard-android.txt\"), \"proguard-rules.pro\"\\n    }\\n}\\npackagingOptions {\\n    pickFirst \\'lib/armeabi-v7a/libgnustl_shared.so\\'\\n    pickFirst \\'lib/x86/libgnustl_shared.so\\'\\n    exclude \\'lib/arm64-v8a/libgnustl_shared.so\\'\\n    exclude \\'lib/x86_64/libgnustl_shared.so\\'\\n}\\n...\\n```\\n\\nIn some cases, the two `exclude` lines cause issues when compiling and can be omitted. I need to look further into what causes this.\\n\\nOn Android, `react-native link` has a bug where it imports `RNSpotifyPackage` using the wrong bundle. You may have to make the following change to `MainApplication.java`:\\n```java\\n...\\nimport com.spotify.sdk.android.authentication.RNSpotifyPackage; // remove this line\\nimport com.lufinkey.react.spotify.RNSpotifyPackage; // replace with this line\\n...\\n```\\n\\nIf you have issues linking the module, please check that gradle is updated to the latest version and that your project is synced. Please reference the [example app](example) to ensure you\\'ve implemented things correctly before opening any issues.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Spotify from \\'rn-spotify-sdk\\';\\n```\\n\\n### Types\\n\\n- **Session**\\n\\n\\tContains information about a session\\n\\t\\n\\t- *Properties*\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t- **accessToken** - A token used to communicate with the Spotify API\\n\\t\\t- **expireTime** - The time that the access token expires, in milliseconds from January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC\\n\\t\\t- **refreshToken** - An encrypted token used to get a new access token when they expire. This should be encrypted by your token swap service, as per OAuth standards.\\n\\t\\t- **scopes** - An array of scopes that the session has access to. A list of scopes can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/).\\n\\n\\n\\n- **PlaybackState**\\n\\n\\tContains information about the current state of the player\\n\\t\\n\\t- *Properties*\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t- **playing** - boolean indicating whether the player is playing\\n\\t\\t- **repeating** - boolean indicating whether the player is repeating\\n\\t\\t- **shuffling** - boolean indicating whether the player is shuffling\\n\\t\\t- **activeDevice** - boolean indicating whether the current device is the one playing\\n\\t\\t- **position** - the position of the player in the current track, in seconds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- **PlaybackTrack**\\n\\n\\tContains information about a track in the playback queue\\n\\t\\n\\t- *Properties*\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t- **name** - The title of the track\\n\\t\\t- **uri** - The uri of the track\\n\\t\\t- **contextName** - The name of the playlist or album that the track is being played from\\n\\t\\t- **contextUri** - The uri of the playlist or album that the track is being played from\\n\\t\\t- **artistName** - The name of the track\\'s artist\\n\\t\\t- **artistUri** - The uri of the track\\'s artist\\n\\t\\t- **albumName** - The name of the album that the track belongs to\\n\\t\\t- **albumUri** - The uri of the album that the track belongs to\\n\\t\\t- **albumCoverArtURL** - A URL for the album art image\\n\\t\\t- **duration** - The length of the track in seconds\\n\\t\\t- **indexInContext** - The track index in the playlist or album that the track is being played from\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- **PlaybackMetadata**\\n\\n\\tContains information about the previous, current, and next tracks in the player\\n\\t\\n\\t- *Properties*\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t- **prevTrack** - A *PlaybackTrack* with information about the previous track\\n\\t\\t- **currentTrack** - A *PlaybackTrack* with information about the current track\\n\\t\\t- **nextTrack** - A *PlaybackTrack* with information about the next track\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- **PlaybackEvent**\\n\\n\\tContains information about a playback event and the state of the player.\\n\\t\\n\\t- *Properties*\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t- **state** - the player\\'s current *PlaybackState*\\n\\t\\t- **metadata** - the player\\'s current *PlaybackMetadata*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Events\\n\\nThis module uses [react-native-events](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-events), so it has all of the same methods as an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) object. All of the events except for **\\'disconnect\\'** / **\\'reconnect\\'** (on Android) and **\\'login\\'** / **\\'logout\\'** come from Spotify\\'s native SDK and are simply forwarded to javascript. If one of these events occurs at a weird time or has strange data, please open an issue on Spotify\\'s [ios-streaming-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/ios-streaming-sdk) or [android-streaming-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/android-streaming-sdk) repo, and not here.\\n\\n- **\\'login\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `session` {Session}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when the module has successfully logged in.\\n\\n- **\\'logout\\'**\\n\\n\\tEmitted when the module is logged out.\\n\\n- **\\'sessionRenewed\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `session` {Session}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when the session has been renewed.\\n\\n- **\\'play\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when playback has started or has resumed.\\n\\n- **\\'pause\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when playback is paused.\\n\\n- **\\'trackChange\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when playback of a new/different track starts.\\n\\n- **\\'metadataChange\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when metadata has changed. This event occurs when playback starts or changes to a different context, when a track switch occurs, etc. This is an informational event that does not require action, but should be used to keep the UI display updated with the latest metadata information.\\n\\n- **\\'contextChange\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when playback starts or changes to a different context than was playing before, such as a change in album or playlist.\\n\\n- **\\'shuffleStatusChange\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when \"shuffle\" is switched on or off.\\n\\n- **\\'repeatStatusChange\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when \"repeat\" is switched on or off.\\n\\n- **\\'active\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when this device has become the active playback device. This event occurs when the users moves playback to this device using Spotify Connect.\\n\\n- **\\'inactive\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when this device is no longer the active playback device. This event occurs when the user moves playback to a different device using Spotify Connect.\\n\\n- **\\'permissionLost\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when this device has temporarily lost permission to stream audio from Spotify. A user can only stream audio on one of her devices at any given time. If playback is started on a different device, this event may occur.\\n\\n- **\\'audioFlush\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when the application should flush its audio buffers (you don\\'t need to deal with this since that\\'s handled by the native code). For example, this event occurs when seeking to a different position within a track.\\n\\n- **\\'audioDeliveryDone\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when the library reaches the end of a playback context and has no more audio to deliver.\\n\\n- **\\'trackDelivered\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\n\\t\\n\\tEmitted when the application accepted all samples from the current track. This is an informative event that indicates that all samples from the current track have been delivered to and accepted by the application. The track has not yet finished playing the last audio sample, but no more audio will be delivered for this track. For nearly all intents and purposes, the track has finished playing.\\n\\n- **\\'disconnect\\'**\\n\\n\\tEmitted when the player loses network connectivity.\\n\\n- **\\'reconnect\\'**\\n\\n\\tEmitted when the player regains network connectivity.\\n\\n- **\\'temporaryPlayerError\\'**\\n\\n\\tEmitted when service has been interrupted, usually by lack of network access. However, it can also occur if there is a problem with Spotify\\'s backend services, or also when the user switches from WiFi to 3G. These errors can occur in many non-critical situations, and thus it is not necessary to show toasts or alert dialogs when receiving this event, or else you will unnecessarily annoy or panic the user. However, it can be useful to know about these events if operations are consistently failing, in which case showing a toast or alert may be justified.\\n\\n- **\\'playerMessage\\'**\\n\\n\\t- `message` {String}\\n\\t\\n\\tCalled when the player has recieved a message for the end user from the Spotify service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Initialization/Authorization Methods\\n\\n- **initialize**( *options* )\\n\\n\\tInitializes the Spotify module and resumes a logged in session if there is one.

If you are not familiar with them, [Understanding Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/learn/refresh-tokens/) can give you a basic idea on how they work.\\n\\n## Additional notes\\n\\nThis module only works for Spotify Premium users.\\n'},\n",

On [its website](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) you can find instructions on how to install it. You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm.\\n\\nOnce installed, clone the repository and install its dependencies running:\\n\\n    $ npm install\\n\\n### Using your own credentials\\nYou will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the Spotify for Developers Dashboard.\\n\\nTo do so, go to [your Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create your application. For the examples, we registered these Redirect URIs:\\n\\n* http://localhost:8888 (needed for the implicit grant flow)\\n* http://localhost:8888/callback\\n\\nOnce you have created your app, replace the `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `client_secret` in the examples with the ones you get from My Applications.\\n\\n## Running the examples\\nIn order to run the different examples, open the folder with the name of the flow you want to try out, and run its `app.js` file. For instance, to run the Authorization Code example do:\\n\\n    $ cd authorization_code\\n    $ node app.js\\n\\nThen, open `http://localhost:8888` in a browser.\\n'},\n",

You can see the list of available scopes in [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/).\\n\\nNext, make a link so the user can log in with his Spotify account:\\n\\n```ruby\\n<%= link_to \\'Sign in with Spotify\\', \\'/auth/spotify\\', method: :post %>\\n```\\n\\nAnd create a route to receive the callback:\\n\\n```ruby\\n# config/routes.rb\\n\\nget \\'/auth/spotify/callback\\', to: \\'users#spotify\\'\\n```\\n\\nRemember you need to tell Spotify this address is white-listed. You can do this by adding it to the Redirect URIs list in your [application page](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications). An example of Redirect URI would be http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback.\\n\\nFinally, create a new RSpotify User with the response received:\\n\\n```ruby\\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\\n  def spotify\\n    spotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(request.env[\\'omniauth.auth\\'])\\n    # Now you can access user\\'s private data, create playlists and much more\\n\\n    # Access private data\\n    spotify_user.country #=> \"US\"\\n    spotify_user.email   #=> \"example@email.com\"\\n\\n    # Create playlist in user\\'s Spotify account\\n    playlist = spotify_user.create_playlist!(\\'my-awesome-playlist\\')\\n\\n    # Add tracks to a playlist in user\\'s Spotify account\\n    tracks = RSpotify::Track.search(\\'Know\\')\\n    playlist.add_tracks!(tracks)\\n    playlist.tracks.first.name #=> \"Somebody That I Used To Know\"\\n\\n    # Access and modify user\\'s music library\\n    spotify_user.save_tracks!(tracks)\\n    spotify_user.saved_tracks.size #=> 20\\n    spotify_user.remove_tracks!(tracks)\\n\\n    albums = RSpotify::Album.search(\\'launeddas\\')\\n    spotify_user.save_albums!(albums)\\n    spotify_user.saved_albums.size #=> 10\\n    spotify_user.remove_albums!(albums)\\n\\n    # Use Spotify Follow features\\n    spotify_user.follow(playlist)\\n    spotify_user.follows?(artists)\\n    spotify_user.unfollow(users)\\n\\n    # Get user\\'s top played artists and tracks\\n    spotify_user.top_artists #=> (Artist array)\\n    spotify_user.top_tracks(time_range: \\'short_term\\') #=> (Track array)\\n\\n    # Check doc for more\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\n\\n## Refreshing the access token\\n\\nThe user\\'s access token is automatically refreshed by RSpotify when needed. This is especially useful if you persist\\nthe user data on a database. This way, the user only need log in to Spotify once during the use of the application.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can store a proc that is invoked when a new access token is generated. This give you the\\nopportunity to persist the new access token for future use. The proc will be invoked with two arguments: the\\nnew access token and the lifetime of the token in seconds. For example, if lifetime value returned from\\nSpotify is 3600, you know that the token will be good for one hour.\\n\\nIn the sample code below, the credentials have been retrieved from some persistent store such as\\nAWS SecretsManager.\\n\\n```ruby\\n\\ncallback_proc = Proc.new { |new_access_token, token_lifetime |\\n   now = Time.now.utc.to_i  # seconds since 1/1/1970, midnight UTC\\n   deadline = now+token_lifetime\\n   #puts(\"new access token will expire at #{Time.at(deadline).utc.to_s}\")\\n   self.save_new_access_token(new_access_token)\\n }\\n\\nspotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(\\n  {\\n    \\'credentials\\' => {\\n       \"token\" => self.credentials[\"access_token\"],\\n       \"refresh_token\" => self.credentials[\"refresh_token\"],\\n       \"access_refresh_callback\" => callback_proc\\n    } ,\\n    \\'id\\' => self.credentials[\"user_id\"]\\n  })\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nRSpotify provides a way to facilitate persistence:\\n\\n```ruby\\nhash = spotify_user.to_hash\\n# hash containing all user attributes, including access tokens\\n\\n# Use the hash to persist the data the way you prefer...\\n\\n# Then recover the Spotify user whenever you like\\nspotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(hash)\\nspotify_user.create_playlist!(\\'my_awesome_playlist\\') # automatically refreshes token\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Getting raw response\\n\\nTo get the raw response from Spotify API requests, just toggle the `raw_response` variable:\\n\\n```ruby\\nRSpotify.raw_response = true\\nRSpotify::Artist.search(\\'Cher\\') #=> (String with raw json response)\\n```\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to use OAuth outside rails, have a look [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization_code_flow) for the requests that need to be made. You should be able to pass the response to RSpotify::User.new just as well, and from there easily create playlists and more for your user.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n1.

       "  'readme_contents': '# fresh_script\\n\\nThis program will search for spotify tracks posted in the HipHopHeads subreddit and add them to a playlist of your choice. HipHopHeads is a subreddit dedicated to everything hiphop, including the latest mixtapes, videos, news, and anything else hip hop related from your favorite artists.\\n\\n## New Features!\\n[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) has recently been added to the project. You can read up on how to get it setup [here](flask.md).\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nThis project uses Python3.\\n\\nYou will need to setup a Spotify developer account and register your app and obtain the following information:\\n* client id\\n* client secret\\n* your spotify username\\n* playlist id of the playlist you want to add the tracks to\\n* the url you want to redirect to for authentication, i.e. http://google.com/\\n  * this must be added under your app settings > Redirect URIs \\n\\nYou will also need to setup a reddit instance with praw. [Here\\'s](https://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/) a useful guide I used to do this.\\n\\n### Setup your Credentials\\n\\nTo set up your credentials, create a new file called `credentials.json` in the root of the project with the following contents:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \"spotify\": {\\n        \"username\": \"[Spotify username]\",\\n        \"client_id\": \"[Spotify client id]\",\\n        \"client_secret\": \"[Spotify client secret]\",\\n        \"redirect\": \"[redirect uri]\"\\n    },\\n    \"reddit\": {\\n        \"username\": \"[reddit username]\",\\n        \"client_id\": \"[praw client id]\",\\n        \"client_secret\": \"[praw client secret]\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n \\n### Installing dependencies\\nThis project uses a dependency manager called [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io). Follow the instructions to install it [here](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv).\\n\\nThe project dependencies are listed in a [Pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile). Using pipenv, you can install all the dependencies with the following commands:\\n```bash\\ncd fresh_script\\npipenv install\\n``` \\n\\nPipenv uses [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to create a python environment with all the dependencies listed in the Pipfile. Before running the fresh.py script, you must first activate the environment:\\n```bash\\npipenv shell\\n```\\n\\nIf you wish to deactivate the environment use the command\\n```bash\\nexit\\n```\\n\\n### Running the script\\n\\nRunning the program is simple. The first time you run it, you will be asked for your Spotify credientials which will be saved to a config file for ease of use in the future. Choose to sort results by hot or new, enter a post limit, and then enjoy.\\n\\n```\\npython3 fresh.py\\n```\\n\\n### Script arguments\\n\\nThe following arguments can be passed to the script\\n\\n| Short | Long             | Type   | Description |\\n|-------|------------------|--------|-------------|\\n| -s    | --sort           | string | Sort by hot, new, rising, random_rising, controversion or top |\\n| -l    | --limit          | int    | How many posts to grab |\\n| -t    | --threshold      | int    | Only posts with score above threshold |\\n| -f    | --fresh          | bool   | Only add tracks with the \\\\[FRESH\\\\] tag |\\n| -ia   | --include-albums | bool   | Include tracks from albums |\\n| -v    | --verbose        | bool   | Output songs being added and other info |\\n| -p    | --playlists      | bool   | List, add, or remove playlists to add songs to |\\n\\n### Running the script using cron\\n\\nWe can use cron to automatically run the script periodically in order to keep it up-to-date. You will need either a macOS computer or Linux server to use cron.\\n\\n1. Follow the `running the script` instructions to make sure your `.config.ini` file is generated with the required parameters\\n2. Run `crontab -e` to open the cron editor, which is similar to vim\\n3. Use the following format to create a line for your cron\\n    ```\\n    * * * * * command to be executed\\n    - - - - -\\n    | | | | |\\n    | | | | ----- Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)\\n    | | | ------- Month (1 - 12)\\n    | | --------- Day of month (1 - 31)\\n    | ----------- Hour (0 - 23)\\n    ------------- Minute (0 - 59)\\n    ```\\n    For example, you would do the following to run this everyday at 9AM\\n    ```\\n    0 9 * * * python /home/jsmith/fresh.py\\n    ```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nI appreciate any help and support. Feel free to [fork](https://github.com/amcquade/fresh_script#fork-destination-box) and [create a pull request](https://github.com/amcquade/fresh_script/compare)\\n'},\n",

Go to [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and select '**Create an app**'.\\n4. Give the name and description that you want and in the dashboard select the app that you've just created.\\n5. Go to your local clone of the project in your machine and open '**YourSensitiveData.swift**' (./SpotifyClone/SpotifyCloneProject/YourSensitiveData).\\n6. Back in your application page of the dashboard, copy the '**Client ID**' and '**Client Secret**' and paste them in '**YourSensitiveData.swift**'.\\n7. Again in the dashboard select '**Users and access**' an then click in '**Add new user**'*(if you try to log-in into an account in the app without adding it here, your app will crash with error 403 because Spotify's API doesn't allow that)*. \\n8. **Great!

Create a Spotify developer app at developer.spotify.com, get a client ID and client secret\\n2. Create an Amazon Alexa skill, choosing **custom**. When you get to the part in the Alexa developer console where you can upload/paste in JSON, run `skill/skill.js` to generate the JSON required\\n```\\n$ node skill/skill.js\\n```\\n3. Enter the application ID from the developer console into `package.json`, under the key `alexa.applicationId`. \\n4. Turn on **Account linking**, choosing **\"Auth Code Grant\"**. Set **\"Authorization URI\"** to `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize`,  **\"Access Token URI\"** to `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`, set client ID and secret, add scopes `user-read-playback-state` and `user-modify-playback-state`, and the three redirect URLs from the account linking details in your developer console for the skill\\n5. Deploy this webapp to somewhere that **supports HTTPS** (required for Alexa skills), for example [Render](https://render.com/)\\n6. Configure the skill to use an HTTPS endpoint of `https://<your-url>/<app-name>` where `app-name` is the name specified in `alexa.app(\\'app-name\\')`, `connect` by default\\n\\n### Adding a language\\n1. Check that the locale is supported by Amazon (see [list of supported locale codes](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/develop-skills-in-multiple-languages.html#h2-code-changes)) and get your locale code (e.g. `en-GB`)\\n2. Create a locale file in `locales/{LOCALE-CODE}.json` (see existing locales for formatting), please do not change the placeholder value names (in double curly brackets e.g. `{{name}}`)\\n3. Create a localised _interaction model_ used by Skill Builder in `skill/locales/{LOCALE-CODE}.json` (please only change the values for the samples for each intent and not the intent names or slots). The formatting should be similar to the other locales, but if more (or fewer) samples are required for the language add as many as possible (more samples mean better accuracy) (formatting done by [alexa-utterances](https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-utterances/blob/master/README.md))\\n4. Add the locale to the list of locales in `skill/skill-i18n.js` (follow the format used by other locales)\\n5. Please also provide [publishing information](https://github.com/thorpelawrence/alexa-spotify-connect/issues/14#issuecomment-365770234) as a comment in your pull request so that it can be localised and published to Amazon in the new language\\n6.

Searches Spotify, controls your music, generally rocks?\\n\\nIt\\'s built off a lot of other people\\'s work—\\n[PHPFunk](https://github.com/phpfunk/alfred-spotify-controls) and\\n[David Ferguson](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/) especially— and tries to match\\nthe functionality of Alfred\\'s integrated iTunes player. It\\'s not perfect, but it does the job. And I think it\\'s pretty cool.\\n\\n## Features ##\\n\\nA quick rundown of its coolness:\\n\\n### A controller, not a workflow ###\\n\\nSpotifious just *feels* fun to use, like a real plugin for Alfred, not a workflow. It\\ncan do in-depth, album-scouring searches and gives you useful information even if something goes wrong. Filter by artist or album, search for specific tracks or just plain see what\\'s playing. It\\'s all there.\\n\\nNot unlike the iTunes Mini Player.\\n\\n### Alfred-like ###\\n\\nSpotifious is also especially Alfred-like. Just start typing to scour Spotify\\'s servers for music. Browse through artists and albums like nobody\\'s business and drill down through Queen\\'s huge anthologies with a snappy context-based search and filtering. Your frequent searches rise to the top, and your controls pop up with the letter `c`.\\n\\n### Smart ###\\n\\nSpotifious uses Packal to make sure you always have the latest version. It gives you a heads-up about what\\'s going on with Spotify *the moment you start it*. And don\\'t worry about errors— we\\'ll handle those. All you have to do is choose how you want to pop it up on screen.\\n\\n## Download & Install ##\\n\\nLatest version: [v0.13.9](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip) | Latest dev build: [v0.13.9](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/dev.zip)\\n\\nAn in-depth [installation guide](http://ben.stolovitz.com/Spotify-for-Alfred/download/) is available on the Spotifious website.\\n\\n1. [Download](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip)\\nthis repository.\\n2. Open `Spotifious.alfredworkflow` in the `dist` folder by double-clicking it or dragging it into\\nAlfred.\\n3. Double-click the first thingy marked `Hotkey`.\\n4. Click the textfield labeled `Hotkey` and press `^⌘⏎`.\\n5. Click `Save` to store the binding.\\n6. Bind the other hotkeys as you wish. Their actions are visible in the `Text` field, under `Argument`.\\n7. Pop up Spotifious with the key command you set— I would have `^⌘⏎`.\\n8. Follow the instructions on the set-up menu.\\n\\t1. You\\'ll be asked to choose your country (for better search results— you can opt out).\\n\\t2. You\\'ll create a Spotify application (or not, you can opt out).\\n\\t3. You\\'ll link the new app to Spotifious.\\n10. Continue on with your merry day— but now with Spotifious.\\n\\n![A visual install guide](include/screenshots/install.png)\\n\\n## How to Use ##\\n\\nSo let\\'s assume you\\'ve downloaded and installed the workflow. Now what?\\n\\n1. Press `^⌘⏎`.\\n\\nGood! You should briefly see a loading entry, then the main menu:\\n\\n![Loading...](include/screenshots/loading.png)\\n![Main Menu](include/screenshots/main_menu.png)\\n\\nYou can action the song title (press `⏎`) to play or pause the song, action \\nthe album or artist to search for that album or artist, or just start typing to \\nsearch for cool music.\\n\\n![Some cool screenshots](include/screenshots/compilation.png)\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve searched for something, you can continue to browse albums and arists through Spotifious. Actioning an artist will bring up a list of their albums, and actioning an album will bring up the track list.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking through a really long album or a particularly prodigious artist, you can also narrow your search by typing a little more— Spotifious will search for results within the album or artist.\\n\\n**Note:** You can always leave a menu and go back just by pressing `⌫`.\\n\\nYou can access a small controls menu by typing `c` at the main menu.\\n\\n![A preview of the controls menu](include/screenshots/controls.png)\\n\\nYou can change your settings by typing `s` at the main menu.\\n\\n![The settings menu](include/screenshots/settings.png)\\n\\n## Acknowledgements ##\\n\\nA lot of people helped out on this:\\n\\n- **vdesabou** and I trade ideas a ton\\n- **PHPfunk** and his PHP Alfred workflow inspired much of `OhAlfred`\\n- **David Ferguson** helped with some iffy Alfred glitches\\n- **jwilsson**\\'s [Spotify PHP web API](http://jwilsson.github.io/spotify-web-api-php/).\\n- a slightly modified version of [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/) icon font face for icons.\\n- and many other people mentioned in the code.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who helped, and thanks to everyone who uses my work!\\nOh, and thanks for reading this whole README. I hope you enjoy Spotifious!\\n\\n## Development ##\\n\\nYou must install dependencies manually. Install \\n[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and then run `make init`. Then you can\\nproceed with development! (if you do not want to do a global install, run\\n`php composer.phar install` from this directory)\\n\\nCommand line development for Alfred 3 is currently not working, since we \\ndepend on several environment variables. Eventually, if you are developing for \\nAlfred version 3 and want to run these files from\\nthe command line (`php -f main.php -- \"args\"`), you will need to run in debug\\nmode : `DEBUG=true php -f main.php -- \"args\"`.\\n\\n### Deployment ###\\n\\n1. Bump version here\\n2. Update `CHANGELOG`\\n3. Update `.alfredworkflow` version\\n4. Update Alfred forum\\n5. Update Packal\\n6. Update GitHub Pages site\\n\\n## TODO ##\\n\\n- Allow `⎇`, `^`, and `⌘` to function as modifiers (Open in Spotify, other things?).\\n- More in-depth Spotify control (radio, queuing, playlists)\\n- Make main menu links go directly to menus.\\n\\n## Changelog ##\\n\\nThis project uses pseudo-SemVer. It will use SemVer when we hit v1.0.0.\\n\\nSee `CHANGELOG.md`.\\n\\n## License ##\\n\\nThis code is licensed as written in the LICENSE.md file.\\n'},\n",

This is a library that allows you to centralise this logic and forget about the ugly parts of making HTTP requests.\\n\\n- [x] 📱 iOS 10.0+\\n- [x] 💻 OS X 10.12+\\n- [x] ⌚️ watchOS 3.0+\\n- [x] 📺 tvOS 10.0+\\n\\nYet another networking library? Well apart from some unique benefits such as built-in rate limiting and powerful request authentication, a significant benefit for you is that any tagged version has been tested in production. We only tag a new release once it’s been used for two weeks by the Spotify app (which has millions of active users a day). As such you can be sure tagged versions are as stable as possible.\\n\\nAs for Spotify, we wanted a light networking library that we had full control over in order to act fast in squashing bugs, and carefully select the feature we needed and were capable of supporting. The architecture also plays very nicely into our MVVM and view aggregation service architectures at Spotify by tying the lifetime of a request to the view.\\n\\n## Architecture :triangular_ruler:\\n`SPTDataLoader` is designed as an HTTP stack with 3 additional layers on top of `NSURLSession`.\\n\\n- **The Application level**, which controls the rate limiting and back-off policies per service, respecting the “Retry-After” header and knowing when or not it should retry the request.\\n- **The User level**, which controls the authentication of the HTTP requests.\\n- **The View level**, which allows automatic cancellation of requests the view has made upon deallocation.\\n\\n### Authentication\\nThe authentication in this case is abstract, allowing the creator of the SPTDataLoaderFactory to define their own semantics for token acquisition and injection. It allows for asynchronous token acquisition if the token is invalid that seamlessly integrates with the HTTP request-response pattern.\\n\\n### Back-off policy\\nThe data loader service allows rate limiting of URLs to be set explicitly or to be determined by the server using the “Retry-After” semantic. It allows back-off retrying by using a jittered exponential backoff to prevent the thundering hordes creating a request storm after a predictable exponential period has expired.\\n\\n## Installation :building_construction:\\nSPTDataLoader can be installed in a variety of ways, either as a dynamic framework, a static library, or through a dependency manager such as CocoaPods or Carthage.\\n\\n### Manually\\n#### Dynamic Framework\\nDrag the [framework](https://github.com/spotify/SPTDataLoader/releases) into the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” area in the “General” section of the target.\\n#### Static Library\\nDrag `SPTDataLoader.xcodeproj` into your App’s Xcode project and link your app with the library in the “Build Phases” section of the target.\\n\\n### CocoaPods\\nTo integrate SPTDataLoader into your project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), add it to your `Podfile`:\\n```ruby\\npod \\'SPTDataLoader\\', \\'~> 2.2\\'\\n```\\n\\n### Carthage\\nTo integrate SPTDataLoader into your project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add it to your `Cartfile`:\\n```ogdl\\ngithub \"spotify/SPTDataLoader\" ~> 2.2\\n```\\n\\n## Usage example :eyes:\\nFor an example of this framework\\'s usage, see the demo application `SPTDataLoaderDemo` in `SPTDataLoader.xcodeproj`. Just follow the instructions in [`ClientKeys.h`](demo/ClientKeys.h).\\n\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoaderService\\nIn your app you should only have 1 instance of SPTDataLoaderService, ideally you would construct this in something similar to an AppDelegate. It takes in a rate limiter, resolver, user agent and an array of NSURLProtocols. The rate limiter allows objects outside the service to change the rate limiting for different endpoints, the resolver allows overriding of host names, and the array of NSURLProtocols allows support for protocols other than http/s.\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoaderRateLimiter *rateLimiter = [SPTDataLoaderRateLimiter rateLimiterWithDefaultRequestsPerSecond:10.0];\\nSPTDataLoaderResolver *resolver = [SPTDataLoaderResolver new];\\nself.service = [SPTDataLoaderService dataLoaderServiceWithUserAgent:@\"Spotify-Demo\"\\n                                                        rateLimiter:rateLimiter\\n                                                           resolver:resolver\\n                                           customURLProtocolClasses:nil];\\n```\\nNote that you can provide all these as nils if you are so inclined, it may be for the best to use nils until you identify a need for these different configuration options.\\n\\n### Defining your own SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser\\nIf you don\\'t need to authenticate your requests you can skip this. In order to authenticate your requests against a backend, you are required to create an implementation of the SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser, the demo project has an example in its SPTDataLoaderAuthoriserOAuth class. In this example we are checking if the request is for the domain which we are attempting to authenticate for, and then performing the authentication (in this case we are injecting an Auth Token into the HTTP header). This interface is asynchronous to allow you to perform token refreshes while a request is in flight in order to hold it until it is ready to be authenticated. Once you have a valid token you can call the delegate (which in this case will be the factory) in order to inform it that the request has been authenticated. Alternatively if you are unable to authenticate the request tell the delegate about the error.\\n\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoaderFactory\\nYour app should ideally only create an SPTDataLoaderFactory once your user has logged in or if you require no authentication for your calls. The factory controls the authorisation of the different requests against authoriser objects that you construct.\\n```objc\\nid<SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser> oauthAuthoriser = [[SPTDataLoaderAuthoriserOAuth alloc] initWithDictionary:oauthTokenDictionary];\\nself.oauthFactory = [self.service createDataLoaderFactoryWithAuthorisers:@[ oauthAuthoriser ]];\\n```\\nWhat we are doing here is using an implementation of an authoriser to funnel all the requests created by this factory into these authorisers.\\n\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoader\\nYour app should create an SPTDataLoader object per view that wants to make requests (e.g. it is best not too share these between classes). This is so when your view model is deallocated the requests made by your view model will also be cancelled.\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoader *dataLoader = [self.oauthFactory createDataLoader];\\n```\\nNote that this data loader will only authorise requests that are made available by the authorisers supplied to its factory.\\n\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoaderRequest\\nIn order to create a request the only information you will need is the URL and where the request came from. For more advanced requests see the properties on SPTDataLoaderRequest which let you change the method, timeouts, retries and whether to stream the results.\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:meURL\\n                                                    sourceIdentifier:@\"playlists\"];\\n[self.dataLoader performRequest:request];\\n```\\nAfter you have made the request your data loader will call its delegate regarding results of the requests.\\n\\n### Handling Streamed Requests\\nSometimes you will want to process HTTP requests as they come in packet by packet rather than receive a large callback at the end, this works better for memory and certain forms of media. For Spotify\\'s purpose, it works for streaming MP3 previews of our songs. An example of using the streaming API:\\n```objc\\nvoid AudioSampleListener(void *, AudioFileStreamID, AudioFileStreamPropertyID, UInt32 *);\\nvoid AudioSampleProcessor(void *, UInt32, UInt32, const void *, AudioStreamPacketDescription *);\\n\\n- (void)load\\n{\\n    NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://i.spotify.com/mp3_preview\"];\\n    SPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:URL sourceIdentifier:@\"preview\"];\\n    request.chunks = YES;\\n    [self.dataLoader performRequest:request];\\n}\\n\\n- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader\\ndidReceiveDataChunk:(NSData *)data\\n       forResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\n{\\n    [data enumerateByteRangesUsingBlock:^(const void *bytes, NSRange byteRange, BOOL *stop) {\\n        AudioFileStreamParseBytes(_audioFileStream, byteRange.length, bytes, 0);\\n    }];\\n}\\n\\n- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader didReceiveInitialResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\n{\\n    AudioFileStreamOpen((__bridge void *)self,\\n                        AudioSampleListener,\\n                        AudioSampleProcessor,\\n                        kAudioFileMP3Type,\\n                        &_audioFileStream);\\n}\\n\\n- (BOOL)dataLoaderShouldSupportChunks:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader\\n{\\n    return YES;\\n}\\n```\\nBe sure to render YES in your delegate to tell the data loader that you support chunks, and to set the requests chunks property to YES.\\n\\n### Rate limiting specific endpoints\\nIf you specify a rate limiter in your service, you can give it a default requests per second metric which it applies to all requests coming out your app. (See “[Creating the `SPTDataLoaderService`](#creating-the-sptdataloaderservice)”). However, you can also specify rate limits for specific HTTP endpoints, which may be useful if you want to forcefully control the rate at which clients can make requests to a backend that does large amounts of work.\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoaderRateLimiter *rateLimiter = [SPTDataLoaderRateLimiter rateLimiterWithDefaultRequestsPerSecond:10.0];\\nNSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.spotify.com/thing/thing\"];\\n[rateLimiter setRequestsPerSecond:1 forURL:URL];\\n```\\nIt should be noted that when you set the requests per second for a URL, it takes the host, and the first component of the URL and rate limits everything that fits that description.\\n\\n### Switching Hosts for all requests\\nThe SPTDataLoaderService takes in a resolver object as one of its arguments. If you choose to make this non-nil, then you can switch the hosts of different requests as they come in. At Spotify we have a number of DNS matches our requests can go through, giving us backups and failsafes in case one of these machines go down. These operations happen in the SPTDataLoaderResolver, where you can specify a number of alternative addresses for the host. An example of Spotify specifying alternative endpoints for its hosts could be:\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoaderResolver *resolver = [SPTDataLoaderResolver new];\\nNSArray *alternativeAddresses = @[ @\"spotify.com\",\\n                                   @\"backup.spotify.com\",\\n                                   @\"backup2.spotify.com\",\\n                                   @\"backup3.spotify.com\",\\n                                   @\"192.168.0.1\",\\n                                   @\"final.spotify.com\" ];\\n[resolver setAddresses:alternativeAddresses forHost:@\"spotify.com\"];\\n```\\nThis allows any request made to spotify.com to use any one of these other addresses (in this order) if spotify.com becomes unreachable.\\n\\n### Using the jittered exponential timer\\nThis library contains a class called SPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer which it uses internally to perform backoffs with retries. The reason it is jittered is to prevent the \"predictable thundering hoardes\" from hammering our services if one of them happens to go down. In order to make use of this class, there are some do\\'s and don\\'ts. For example, do not initialise the class like so:\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer *timer = [SPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer exponentialTimerWithInitialTime:0.0\\n                                                                                              maxTime:10.0];\\nNSTimeInterval backoffTime = 0.0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {\\n    backoffTime = timer.timeIntervalAndCalculateNext;\\n}\\n```\\nThis will result in the backoffTime remaining at 0. Why? Because 0.0 multiplied by an exponential number is still 0. A good initial time might be 0.5 or 1.0 seconds. You will also notice that the backoffTime will get further away from the raw exponential time the more times you calculate the next interval:\\n```objc\\nSPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer *timer = [SPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer exponentialTimerWithInitialTime:1.0\\n                                                                                              maxTime:1000.0];\\nNSTimeInterval backoffTime = 0.0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {\\n    backoffTime = timer.timeIntervalAndCalculateNext;\\n}\\n```\\nThis will result in a backoffTime that has drifted far away from its vanilla exponential calculation. Why? Because we add a random jitter to the calculations in order to prevent clients from connecting at the same time, in order to spread the load out evenly when experiencing a reconnect storm. The jitter gets greater along with the exponent.\\n\\n### Consumption observation\\nSPTDataLoaderService allows you to add a consumption observer whose purpose is to monitor the data consumption of the service for both uploads and downloads. This object must conform to the SPTDataLoaderConsumptionObserver protocol. This is quite easy considering it is a single method like so:\\n```objc\\n- (void)load\\n{\\n    [self.service addConsumptionObserver:self];\\n}\\n\\n- (void)unload\\n{\\n    [self.service removeConsumptionObserver:self];\\n}\\n\\n- (void)endedRequestWithResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\n                 bytesDownloaded:(int)bytesDownloaded\\n                   bytesUploaded:(int)bytesUploaded\\n{\\n    NSLog(@\"Bytes Downloaded: %d\", bytesDownloaded);\\n    NSLog(@\"Bytes Uploaded: %d\", bytesUploaded);\\n}\\n```\\nAlso note that this isn\\'t just the payload, it also includes the headers.\\n\\n### Creating a custom authoriser\\nThe SPTDataLoader architecture is designed to centralise authentication around the user level (in this case represented by the factory). In order to do that you must inject an authoriser you made yourself into the factory when it is created. An authoriser in most cases will be injecting an Authorisation header into any request it wants to authorise. An example below shows how a standard authoriser might be constructed for an OAuth flow.\\n```objc\\n@synthesize delegate = _delegate;\\n\\n- (NSString *)identifier\\n{\\n    return @\"OAuth\";\\n}\\n\\n- (BOOL)requestRequiresAuthorisation:(SPTDataLoaderRequest *)request\\n{\\n    // Here we check the hostname to see if it one of the hostnames we authorise against\\n    // It is also advisable to check whether we are using HTTPS, if we are not we should not inject our Authorisation\\n    // header in order to keep it secret from prying eyes\\n    return [request.URL.host isEqualToString:@\"myauth.com\"] && [request.URL.scheme isEqualToString:@\"https\"];\\n}\\n\\n- (void)authoriseRequest:(SPTDataLoaderRequest *)request\\n{\\n    [request addValue:@\"My Token\" forHeader:@\"Authorization\"];\\n    [self.delegate dataLoaderAuthoriser:self authorisedRequest:request];\\n}\\n\\n- (void)requestFailedAuthorisation:(SPTDataLoaderRequest *)request response:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\n{\\n    // This tells us that the server returned a 400 error code indicating that the authorisation did not work\\n    // Commonly this means you should attempt to get another authorisation token\\n    // Or the response object should be inspected for additional information from the backend\\n}\\n\\n- (void)refresh\\n{\\n    // Forces a refresh of the authorisation token\\n}\\n```\\nAs you can see all we are doing here is playing with the headers. It should be noted that if you receive an authoriseRequest: call the rest of the request will not execute until you have either sent the delegate a signal telling it the request has been authorised or failed to be authorised.\\n\\n### Swift overlay\\nAdditional APIs that enhance usage within Swift applications are available through the `SPTDataLoaderSwift` library.\\n```swift\\n// Creating a DataLoader instance\\nlet dataLoader = dataLoaderFactory.makeDataLoader(/* optional */responseQueue: myCustomQueue)\\n\\n// Creating a Request instance -- all functions can be chained\\nlet request = dataLoader.request(modelURL, sourceIdentifier: \"model-page\")\\n\\n// Modifying the request properties\\nrequest.modify { request in\\n    request.body = modelData\\n    request.method = .patch\\n    request.addValue(\"application/json\", forHeader: \"Accept\")\\n}\\n\\n// Adding a response validator\\nrequest.validate { response in\\n    guard response.statusCode.rawValue == 200 else {\\n        throw ValidationError.badStatus(code: response.statusCode.rawValue)\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// Adding a response serializer (and executing the request)\\nrequest.responseDecodable { response in\\n    modelResultHandler(response.result)\\n}\\n\\n// Cancelling the request\\nrequest.cancel()\\n```\\nYou can also define serializers to handle custom data types:\\n```swift\\nstruct ProtobufResponseSerializer<Message: SwiftProtobuf.Message>: ResponseSerializer {\\n    func serialize(response: SPTDataLoaderResponse) throws -> Message {\\n        guard response.error == nil else {\\n            throw response.error.unsafelyUnwrapped\\n        }\\n\\n        guard let data = response.body else {\\n            throw ResponseSerializationError.dataNotFound\\n        }\\n\\n        return try Message(serializedData: data)\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nlet modelSerializer = ProtobufResponseSerializer<MyCustomModel>()\\nrequest.responseSerializable(serializer: modelSerializer) { response in\\n    modelResultHandler(response.result)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Background story :book:\\nAt Spotify we have begun moving to a decentralised HTTP architecture, and in doing so have had some growing pains. Initially we had a data loader that would attempt to refresh the access token whenever it became invalid, but we immediately learned this was very hard to keep track of. We needed some way of injecting this authorisation data automatically into a HTTP request that didn\\'t require our features to do any more heavy lifting than they were currently doing.\\n\\nThus we came up with a way to elegantly inject tokens in a Just-in-time manner for requests that require them. We also wanted to learn from our mistakes with our proprietary protocol, and bake in back-off policies early to avoid us DDOSing our own backends with huge amounts of eronious requests.\\n\\n## Documentation :books:\\nSee the [`SPTDataLoader` documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SPTDataLoader) on [CocoaDocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org) for the full documentation.\\n\\nYou can also add it to [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) if you want to, using the following Dash feed:\\n```\\ndash-feed://http%3A%2F%2Fcocoadocs.org%2Fdocsets%2FSPTDataLoader%2FSPTDataLoader.xml\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing :mailbox_with_mail:\\nContributions are welcomed, have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more information.\\n\\n## License :memo:\\nThe project is available under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.\\n'},\n",

If you are running on Mac OS X or Linux, you can control the locally running instance. If\\nyou are running on any platform with a network connection (including Windows - and even headless!)\\nand have a Spotify premium subscription, you can control an instance of Spotify via the Spotify\\nConnect feature.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n* Spotify client integration for GNU/Linux (via D-Bus) and OS X (via AppleScript)\\n* Device playback display & selection using the Spotify Connect API (requires premium)\\n* Communicates with the Spotify API via Oauth2\\n* Displays the current track in mode line or title bar\\n* Create playlists (public or private)\\n* Browse the Spotify featured playlists, your own playlists, and their tracks\\n* Search for tracks and playlists that match the given keywords\\n* Easily control basic Spotify player features like, play/pause, previous,\\n  next, shuffle, and repeat with the Smudge Remote minor mode\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n(Requires Emacs 27.1+)\\n\\n`package.el` is the built-in package manager in Emacs.\\n\\nSmudge is available on the two major package.el community maintained repos - MELPA Stable and MELPA.\\n\\nYou can install Smudge with the following command:\\n\\nM-x package-install [RET] smudge [RET]\\n\\nTo manually install Smudge instead, just clone this project somewhere in your\\ndisk, add that directory in the `load-path`, and require the `smudge` module:\\n\\n````el\\n(add-to-list \\'load-path \"<smudge-dir>\")\\n(require \\'smudge)\\n````\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\n````el\\n;; Settings\\n(setq smudge-oauth2-client-secret \"<spotify-app-client-secret>\")\\n(setq smudge-oauth2-client-id \"<spotify-app-client-id>\")\\n(define-key smudge-mode-map (kbd \"C-c .\") \\'smudge-command-map)\\n````\\n\\nThat keymap prefix is just a suggestion, following the conventions suggested for minor modes as\\ndefined in the Emacs manual [Key Binding\\nConventions](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html#Key-Binding-Conventions).

If you want to display the status in the title bar when using a graphical display,\\nyou can set the following:\\n\\n````el\\n(setq smudge-status-location \\'title-bar)\\n\\n````\\n\\nValid values include `\\'title-bar`, `\\'modeline` and `nil`, where nil turns off the display of the\\nplayer status completely. If the value is set to `title-bar` but you are not using a graphical\\ndisplay, the player status will be displayed in the mode line instead.\\n\\nIf you want to customize the separator between the existing title bar text and the player status,\\nyou can set the following, i.e.:\\n````el\\n(setq smudge-title-bar-separator \"----\")\\n````\\nOtherwise, it defaults to 4 spaces.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nCopyright (C) Daniel Fernandes Martins\\n\\nDistributed under the GPL v3 License.

The quickest way to get up and running is to use a Jamstack platform like Netlify or GitHub Pages.\\n\\n* Fork this repository\\n* Connect your repo to your Jamstack platform\\n* Add your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret to the platforms environment variables\\n* Deploy!\\n\\n---\\n# How to use\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\nYou will need:\\n* A GitHub account\\n* A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account\\n* Spotify Client Keys\\n* A device to display Nowify\\n\\n### 1. Fork this repository\\n\\nOn this page, click on the \\'Fork\\' button in the top-right to create a copy of the repo as-is on your account. Alternatively, you can clone the repo and push to GitHub.\\n\\n### 2. Create a new project on Netlify\\nLog in to Netlify and click \\'New site from Git\\'.\\n\\nIf you\\'re doing this for the first time, you will need to authorise your GitHub account with Netlify by following the instructions.\\n\\nOnce authorised, follow the on-screen instructions to connect your repository. You should be fine to leave the default settings here as-is.\\n\\nClick on \\'Deploy site\\'.\\n\\n_Note: Nowify should use Node 14. This has been set in the project environment. I\\'ve only ever attempted this Netlify, so cannot help you if you use another platform._\\n\\n### 3. Create Spotify Client keys.\\nTo allow authorisation to your track data, you\\'ll need to generate Spotify API keys. You can do this by logging in to the [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) creating an app.\\n\\nCall the application \\'Nowify\\'.\\n\\nSet the _Redirect URI_ as the URL of your project in Netlify. This must be set else Spotify won\\'t authorise Nowify.\\n\\n**Important:** The _Redirect URI_ entered in this field must match the URL of your Netlify site exactly, or you\\'ll receive authorisation errors. A common issue is that Spotify will automatically add a trailing slash to the URL upon saving. For example: `https://example.netlify.com` vs `https://example.netlify.com/`.\\n\\nYou can leave the other settings (Callback URL, Bundle IDs etc) blank.\\n\\nCopy down the Client Secret and Client ID and save your app in the Spotify Dashboard.\\n\\n### 4. Add the Client ID and Client Secret to Netlify\\n\\nNow that we have our Spotify API keys, we must let Nowify know that they exist.\\n\\nTo do this, navigate to Netlify > Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment\\n\\nUnder _Environment variables_, add two fields. The _Keys_ can be found in the `env.sample` file and the values will be the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_, respectively.\\n\\nHit save.\\n\\n### 5. View Nowify\\n\\nOnce the environment variables are in, you will have to navigate to your Netlify site overview > Deploys > Trigger Deploy drop-down > click \\'Clear cache and deploy site\\' and wait for deployment to complete. You can now navigate to your Netlify site. You\\'ll be prompted with a Spotify login button. Do that, and you\\'re good to go!\\n\\n---\\n\\nAlternatively, you can clone the repo, compile the code offline, and upload to your own webserver (more advanced users only). If you\\'re considering doing this, I\\'ll assume that you somewhat know you\\'re way around build tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Original Write up:\\n[https://ashcroft.dev/blog/now-playing-screen-spotify-raspberry-pi-es6/](https://ashcroft.dev/blog/now-playing-screen-spotify-raspberry-pi-es6/)\\n\\n### Brief About:\\nNowify was a project that I originally made in 2017 when I wanted to learn more modern Javascript. Over the years, I\\'ve learned a lot more and had people contact me about Nowify, so I wanted to build a more modern version of it using modern tools. This is still a learning exercise, but hopefully one that\\'s more usable. If you\\'d like to view the old repository, that can be found on the `old` branch.\\n'},\n",

It shows on which of your devices you’re playing the song. If you like you can also display the album cover.\\n\\nTo be able to display your currently playing song the module must connect to the Spotify service and query your private data. For obvious reasons this is not possible for arbitrary apps – or for that matter MagicMirror modules. There are third party solutions which will enable access to your Spotify data. This module is designed to be independent from third party services. Everything you need is in this module respectively is created by yourself.\\n\\n## Screenshots\\n| ![Screenshot when nothing is playing](img/readme/screenshot_nothing_playing.png) | ![Screenshot of a song playing without cover art](img/readme/screenshot_without_coverart.png) | ![Screenshot of a song playing with cover art](img/readme/screenshot_with_coverart.png) |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Nothing is playing. | A song is playing and `showCoverArt` is set to `false`. | A song is playing and `showCoverArt` is set to `true`. |\\n\\n## Preconditions\\n\\n* MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> instance\\n* Node.js version >= 7\\n* npm\\n* a Spotify account\\n\\n\\n## Installing\\nInstalling the module is quite straight forward. Getting it to display your playing songs requires a bit more work.\\n\\n### Step 1 – Install the module\\n\\nIn your MagicMirror directory: \\n\\n```bash\\ncd modules\\ngit clone https://github.com/raywo/MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify.git\\ncd MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2 – Create and authorise a Spotify app\\nIn order to be able to connect to the Spotify API you need to create an app in the [Spotify developer area](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). Then you need to authorise the app to access your personal data. Et voilà!\\n\\nThe module provides you with a special app which describes all the necessary steps and which guides you through the whole process. To use this app change into the `authorization` folder and start the app by typing `node app`. \\n\\n```bash\\ncd authorization\\nnode app\\n```\\n\\nWhen the app is running you can access it by opening `localhost:8888` in your browser. Provided you are doing this directly on your Raspberry Pi. If you want to access the app remotely just type the ip address or the name of your Raspberry like so for instance: `http://raspi:8888`. Then you should see the authorisation app like below.\\n\\n|![Screenshot for authorisation app](img/readme/screenshot_authorize_app.png)|\\n|---|\\n\\nNow just follow the steps described there. After successful authorisation the app will display a code snippet under the heading **Step 3: Configure your mirror**. Copy that snippet and paste it into your mirror’s `config.js`. Configure the rest to your needs and you’re good to go.\\n\\n\\n## Updating\\n\\nGo to the module’s folder inside MagicMirror modules folder and pull the latest version from GitHub and install:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit pull\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Configuring\\nThere is not very much to configure but here are the options:\\n\\n| Option | Description |\\n|--------|-------------|\\n| `showCoverArt` | <p>A boolean value decribing whether an album cover photo should be displayed or not.</p><p>**Type:** `boolean` **OPTIONAL**<br>**Example:** `false`<br>**Default Value:** `true`</p> |\\n| `updatesEvery` | <p>An integer determining the interval for display updates.</p><p>**Type:** `integer` **OPTIONAL**<br>**Example:** `5`<br>**Default Value:** `1`</p><p>**Note:** With the default setting the display is updated every second. So when you skip to the next song it is virtually immediately visible. Also the progress bar runs smoothly. If you increase the value you may relieve the strain on your Raspberry’s processor but your display will not be as up-to-date. </p> |\\n| `clientID` | <p>A string describing the `clientID` of your Spotify app.</p><p>**Type:** `string` **REQUIRED**<br>**Example:** `\"acecg8a4...\"`<br>**Default Value:** none</p><p>**Note:** The easiest way to get that value is by copying the code snippet from step 3 in the [authorisation app](#step-2-–-create-and-authorise-a-spotify-app).</p> |\\n| `clientSecret` | <p>A string describing the `clientSecret` of your Spotify app.</p><p>**Type:** `string` **REQUIRED**<br>**Example:** `\"87978346...\"`<br>**Default Value:** none</p><p>**Note:** The easiest way to get that value is by copying the code snippet from step 3 in the [authorisation app](#step-2-–-create-and-authorise-a-spotify-app).</p> |\\n| `accessToken` | <p>A string describing the `accessToken ` of your Spotify app.</p><p>**Type:** `string` **REQUIRED**<br>**Example:** `\"WaIO1987...\"`<br>**Default Value:** none</p><p>**Note:** The easiest way to get that value is by copying the code snippet from step 3 in the [authorisation app](#step-2-–-create-and-authorise-a-spotify-app).</p> |\\n| `refreshToken` | <p>A string describing the `refreshToken ` of your Spotify app.</p><p>**Type:** `string` **REQUIRED**<br>**Example:** `\"HIuLH798...\"`<br>**Default Value:** none</p><p>**Note:** The easiest way to get that value is by copying the code snippet from step 3 in the [authorisation app](#step-2-–-create-and-authorise-a-spotify-app).</p> |\\n\\nHere is an example for an entry in `config.js`\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n    module: \"MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify\",\\n    position: \"top_right\",\\n\\n    config: {\\n        showCoverArt: false,\\n        clientID: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\",\\n        clientSecret: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>\",\\n        accessToken: \"<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>\",\\n        refreshToken: \"<YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Special Thanks\\n\\n* [Michael Teeuw](https://github.com/MichMich) for inspiring me and many others to build a MagicMirror module.\\n* The community of magicmirror.builders for help in the development process and all contributors for finding and fixing errors in this module.\\n\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you find any problems, bugs or have questions, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/raywo/MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify/issues) in this repository.\\n'},\n",

Album artworks as well as title and artist name\\nare fetched from Spotify\\'s Web API over WiFi and displayed on a ILI9341 color TFT screen. The currently played song can be\\npaused, played and skipped to the next or previous song in the playlist.\\n\\nA full OAuth 2.0 web flow is used to acquire the necessary access and refresh tokens to permit the user to control the player. In order to\\nrun this project on your device you will have to setup an application on Spotify\\'s developer dashboard.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n - Artwork Download\\n - Control Player on touch screen: Play, Pause, Next, Prev\\n - Authentication and Authorization (OAuth 2.0 flow) On device.\\n\\nDemo Video:\\n\\n [![Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xKmXMUoo8ps/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKmXMUoo8ps)\\n\\n## Recommended Hardware\\n\\nWe developed this project specifically for our [ESP8266 Color Kit](https://thingpulse.com/product/esp8266-wifi-color-display-kit-2-4/). If you appreciate the hard work and our willingness to open-source projects like this one then please support us by buying our hardware.\\n\\n<a href=\"https://thingpulse.com/product/esp8266-wifi-color-display-kit-2-4/\">\\n  <img src=\"https://thingpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ThingPulse-Color-Kit-2-768x534.jpg\" width=\"300\">\\n</a>\\n\\n\\n## Contributions\\n\\nPlease see our [Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute to this project. Contributions are more than welcome!\\n\\n## Service level promise\\n\\n<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://thingpulse.com/assets/ThingPulse-open-source-community.png\" width=\"150\">\\n</td><td>This is a ThingPulse <em>community</em> project. See our <a href=\"https://thingpulse.com/about/open-source-commitment/\">open-source commitment declaration</a> for what this means.</td></tr></table>\\n\\n## Setup Instructions\\n\\n### Precondition\\n\\nThe below instructions assume that your Arduino IDE is properly setup to work with the ThingPulse Color Kit. See our standalone tutorials for [setting up the IDE](https://docs.thingpulse.com/how-tos/Arduino-IDE-for-ESP8266/) and [installing the drivers](https://docs.thingpulse.com/how-tos/install-drivers/) if you need help with that.\\n\\n### Prepare Project in Arduino IDE\\n\\n1. Download this project either as ZIP file or check it out with Git\\n1. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.\\n1. Install the required Arduino libraries. Go to Sketch > Include Library... > Manage Libraries.... Then, for each library, put its name into the text field to have its metadata pulled from the internet and displayed below. Select the latest version and install it.\\n\\t1. [Mini Grafx](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/mini-grafx) library (by ThingPulse, V 1.0.0 or later)\\n\\t1. [JPEGDecoder](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/jpeg-decoder) library (by Bodmer, Makoto Kurauchi, Rich Geldreich, v1.7.8 or later). After installing the library go to your Arduino sketchbook folder (the one configured in Arduino Preferences > Sketchbook location). In that folder open file `libraries/JPEGDecoder/src/User_config.h` and comment line 5 so that it reads `//#define LOAD_SD_LIBRARY`.\\n\\t1. [JSON Streaming Parser](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/json-streaming-parser) library (by Daniel Eichhorn, v1.0.5 or later)\\n\\t1. [ThingPulse XPT2046 Touch](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/thing-pulse-xpt2046-touch) (our fork of the original lib by Paul Stoffregen, v1.2.0 or later)\\n1. Set your *WiFi credentials* in the `settings.h` file\\n1. Complete the steps below to get the values for the *Spotify settings* required in `settings.h`\\n\\n### Get Access to the Spotify API\\n\\n1. Go to [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and login to or sign up for the Spotify Developer Dashboard\\n\\n2. Click on \"My New App\"\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyDashboard.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n3. Fill out the form. Give your new app a name you can attribute to this project. It\\'s safe to select \"I don\\'t know\" for the type of application.\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyAppSignUp1.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n4. At the end of the 3 steps click \"Submit\"\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyppSignUp3.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n5. Set the unique Client ID and Client Secret as values for the respective variables in `settings.h`\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyCredentials.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n6. Click on \"Edit Settings\". Add \"http://esp8266.local/callback/\" to the Redirect URIs section.\\n\\n   **NOTE** If you\\'re running more than ThingPulse Spotify Remote in the same WiFi network you should choose a unique name rather than \"esp8266\". Regardless of what you choose it has to reflect what you set as `espotifierNodeName` in `settings.h`\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyAppSettings.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n7. Don\\'t forget to save your settings.\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyAppSettingsSave.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n### Compile and run the application\\n\\nAfter all this configuration it\\'s about time to run the application!\\n\\n1. First check the configuration in `settings.h` one more time to ensure the Spotify values match those set on the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Better safe than sorry, they say.\\n\\n2. Attach your [ESP8266 Color Kit](https://thingpulse.com/product/esp8266-wifi-color-display-kit-2-4/) to your computer and select the correct serial port and flash settings in the Arduino IDE as per https://docs.thingpulse.com/guides/wifi-color-display-kit/#select-flash-mode-and-flash-size\\n\\n3. Upload the code to your ESP8266\\n\\n4. When you run this the first time you\\'ll have to go through additional steps. The display will ask you to open the browser at a specific location. This will redirect you to the dialog below.\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyConnectScreen.png\" width=\"400\">\\n\\n5. The next step is to calibrate the screen. Click on the white circles\\n\\n6. Now open your Spotify player and start a song. If everything worked out you\\'ll see the song information with artwork on the TFT screen!\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': '# Spotify Search\\n\\n**Objective:** You\\'ve been handed a partially-finished music search app using jQuery, AJAX, and the Spotify API. It uses Spotify\\'s search endpoint to search for tracks (songs).\\n\\n\\n![completed app gif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3254910/13961403/b3549c56-f019-11e5-86ad-c1814cf7b6c5.gif)\\n\\n**In this training, you\\'ll refactor a music search app to use Handlebars templating.**\\n\\n\\n## Project Specifications\\n\\n1. Create a form to search for tracks (songs). This form needs an input field for the search keyword.\\n2. When a user submits the form, there must be an AJAX call to Spotify\\'s search endpoint. Use the search keyword from the form as the track to search.\\n4. On success of the AJAX call, render the search results on the page. Use Handlebars templating. Include at least the track name and artist name for each result.\\n5. Each time the user submits the form, clear any previous search results from the view.\\n\\n## Bonus Ideas\\n\\nOptionally, challenge yourself to take the project farther!\\n\\n1. Display a track\\'s album artwork next to each search result in the view. **Hint:** If you try to access the album artwork but none is available, your app will break. Prevent this from happening with a check to see if any artwork is available first.\\n\\n2. Spotify gives us a `preview_url` for each track. Create a play button for each track in your view that opens the `preview_url` in a new tab (it will start playing the song!).\\n\\n3. It would be nice to let the user know something is happening in the few milliseconds between submitting the form and getting data on the page. Show `loading.gif` (provided in the `images` directory) when the form submits, and hide it when you get data back from Spotify.\\n\\n4. Handle the case where no data comes back from Spotify. You\\'ll want to let the user know that there are no results, rather than just showing a blank page.\\n\\n5. Handle the case where the user submits the search with an empty keyword. Check out the error in the console when submitting this form blank; Spotify considers this a \"bad request!\" If the user tries to submit a blank form, don\\'t search and instead remind them to enter a keyword.\\n\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your class work folder (`wdi`, `devel`, or whichever folder you keep your WDI work in on your local machine). You\\'ll work in the code from this project\\'s `starter-code` directory.\\n\\n2. Practice querying Spotify\\'s search endpoint using Postman or `curl` with a few different search keywords. Spotify will require that you set `type=track` in your request URL. Look at the response data, and figure out how you would access the track name and artist name for a particular track (this will involve accessing values from JSON with nested objects and arrays).\\n\\n3. Once you feel comfortable with the structure of the response data, work on using AJAX to make the API call to Spotify when the user submits the form.\\n\\n4. Start by `console.log`-ing the response data. Once you have that working, access the data you want to display (track name and artist name).\\n\\n5. One you know how to access the data from the results, use jQuery to `append` it to the page. You might want to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\" target=\"_blank\">Array#forEach</a> to iterate through all the tracks Spotify returns in the response data.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n* <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery.ajax()</a>\\n* <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Search Endpoint</a>\\n'},\n",

This takes about 12 hours to run.\\n\\nThe output data from these two scripts are loaded by the server and used to build a graph (via networkx) that is used to satisfy the find_path requests.\\n\\nThe server relies on cherrypy and networkx.\\n\\n\\n# The Web App\\nThe web app is a relatively simple app that solicits artist names from the user, calls the find_path method on the server to get the path and displays the path to the user.

       "  'readme_contents': \"# WebSockets for Spotify Connect API\\n\\nA Socket.IO plugin that enables interfacing with Spotify's Connect API using WebSockets.\\n\\nThe advantage of using this package is that it takes away the need for client-side polling (and diffing). By connecting the client to the server with WebSockets, the server will handle all of the polling and diffing, and the client will simply be notified whenever there is a change to the state of the player. This makes the client side code a lot cleaner and simpler.\\n\\nIt should be noted that this project does not fully solve the problems discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/492), in that there is still polling taking place (one request per second right now) and therefore hitting rate limits is a possibility. If you do hit the rate limit using this plugin, please let me know how many concurrent users caused it, because I would like to integrate functionality that automatically throttles the poll rate based on the number of concurrent websocket connections.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nThis package has been developed to work with an Express + Socket.IO server environment.\\n\\nIf you want to skip the server setup and go straight to working with your app, use this testing url in the meantime: https://spotify-connect-ws.herokuapp.com/connect\\n\\n#### Examples\\n\\nI have made a couple of example projects that show how your server and client apps might look when using this package.\\n\\nClient (React.js): https://github.com/lrholmes/spotify-connect-ws-react-example\\n\\nServer: https://github.com/lrholmes/spotify-connect-ws-server-example\\n\\nServer:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install spotify-connect-ws --save\\n# or\\nyarn add spotify-connect-ws\\n```\\n\\n```js\\nimport express from 'express'\\nimport socketio from 'socket.io'\\nimport connectSocket from 'spotify-connect-ws'\\n\\nconst app = express()\\nconst server = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3001)\\n\\nconst io = socketio(server)\\nio.of('connect').on('connection', connectSocket)\\n```\\n\\nClient:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install socket.io-client --save\\n# or\\nyarn add socket.io-client\\n```\\n\\n```js\\nimport openSocket from 'socket.io-client'\\nconst io = openSocket('/connect')\\n// or if using testing url\\nconst io = openSocket('https://spotify-connect-ws.herokuapp.com/connect')\\n\\nio.emit('initiate', { accessToken: 'access token' })\\n```\\n\\n### How it works\\n\\nTo start watching the player for changes, use `io.emit('initiate', { accessToken })`. If successful, the first event receieved by the client, named `initial_state` will provide the full Player object from Spotify. You should use this to set up any views or state needed for your app. After this event, your client will receive events based on changes to the Player's state (e.g. playback paused, track changed). All of these events are listed below.\\n\\n### Events\\n\\n#### Received Events\\n\\nThese events are used in combination with `on()` to receive changes to the player state.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```js\\nio.on('track_change', track => {\\n  // update state/store with new track\\n})\\n```\\n\\n`initial_state`: This event is received once, after initiating the connection. It contains the full Player object.\\n\\n`connect_error`: Any errors encountered on the server will be sent back to the client here.\\n\\n`track_change`: Received after a track change is detected, along with the Spotify Track object for the new track.\\n\\n`playback_started`: Indicates playback starting (both when a new track starts and when a paused track resumes playback)\\n\\n`playback_paused`\\n\\n`device_change`: A change to the active playback device has occured. The new Device is sent back with this event.\\n\\n`volume_change`: Volume has been changed - the volume percent is sent back.\\n\\n`track_end`: The current track has ended. This event is detected on the serverside by checking if the track is has less than two seconds of playback remaining. This is reliable in my testing, but there is probably a better way of checking for track end.\\n\\n#### Sent Events\\n\\nThese are used to trigger playback events.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```js\\nio.emit('play', { id: '5Y17vKO1JtfnxIlM4vNQT6' })\\n```\\n\\n`initiate`: Accepts an object with required `accessToken` parameter. This event begins watching the player state and is required before using any of the other events.\\n\\n`play`: This event accepts an optional object representing the parameters for the Connect API (`uris`, `context_uri`, `offset`), but additionally accepts `id`, representing a Spotify Track ID, that will play that track. If no object is provided, the server will attempt to `resume` playback.\\n\\n`resume`: Resume playback.\\n\\n`pause`: Pause playback.\\n\\n`seek`: Seek to position provided as argument (target position in milliseconds).\\n\\n`next_track`: Skip to next track in queue\\n\\n`previous_track`: Go to previous track in play history\\n\\n`set_volume`: Set volume to integer representing percentage provided as argument\\n\\n`transfer_playback`: Transfer playback to another device, accepts an object with following params: `id`, the device ID, and `play`, which defaults to `false` but if `true` will force playback on the new device.\\n\\n`access_token`: This will set the socket's access token. If you are refreshing your token, ensure to send this event after.\\n\\n### Contributing\\n\\nPlease contribute with any changes or fixes you'd like to see! Especially if you have any experience with Socket.IO, I'm sure that I've probably made some mistakes here or there.\\n\\nSome things that I would like to add soon:\\n\\n* The rest of the Player options (shuffle, repeat)\\n* Tests\\n* The ability to manage devices (events for new devices detected)\\n\\nLonger term, it might be possible to dynamically adjust the poll time when there are more users connected, but first we'll need to know at what point rate limits become an issue.\\n\"},\n",

This bot is wrtten in Python and is being developed with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) provided by the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) team. The documentation for the API that I used is located [here](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)\\n\\n<a id = \"use\"></a>\\n## Usage\\nTo use the bot, you will first need to create a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account. Once you do that, you can call the bot from anywhere by calling the bot with @spotify_telegram_bot.\\n\\nTo make a search, call the bot and type. The bot will respond with an option to grab the top result of either a track, artist, album or playlist and you can click which you would like to get a Spotify link to the item.\\n\\n<a id = \"run\"></a>\\n## Running the Bot\\n<a id = \"local\"></a>\\n### Local\\nTo run the bot on your local machine, go into the config.json file and switch the \"prod\" value to \"false\". Then, you can run the bot just by typing the following:\\n```\\npython3 spotify_bot.py\\n```\\nAfter that, the bot should be running and will receive requests as long as it is running.\\n\\n<a id = \"heroku\"></a>\\n### Heroku\\nTo run the bot locally using Heroku, create a .env file using the format KEY=VALUE, where KEY is the key to access the VALUE, and the VALUE is you Telegram API key. You should also follow the same format for your Spotify Developer client ID and client secret keys.\\nExample:\\n```\\nTELEGRAM_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY\\nCLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\\nCLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY\\n```\\n\\nYou can then access this value by using:\\n```\\nos.environ[\"TELEGRAM_KEY\"]\\nos.environ[\"CLIENT_ID\"]\\nos.environ[\"CLIENT_SECRET\"]\\n```\\nTo run the bot, just type:\\n```\\nheroku local\\n```\\nAnd then the bot will accept requests.\\n\\nTo host the bot on Heroku, first create a free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). After doing that, follow the instructions to set up your bot on your Heroku repo. After doing that, go to your config variables in Heroku (located under \\'Settings\\') and make sure to add the environment variables that you created in your .env file to here as well. If the bot ran correctly using Heroku locally, then it should run fine when hosted.\\n\\n<a id = \"tests\"></a>\\n## Running the Unit Tests\\nThe unit tests have been written using the Python 3 `unittest` library. To run the unit tests, run the following in your terminal:\\n```\\npython3 tests.py\\n```\\n\\nThis will run the unit tests and will let you know if all of them passed or not. If you would like more visibility into which tests pass and which ones did not, run the tests with the `-v` argument like so:\\n```\\npython3 tests.py -v\\n```\\n\\nThis will tell you the results of each of the tests individually as opposed to only telling you if all of them passed or not.\\n\\n'},\n",

Easily transfer all your local songs over to a playlist on Spotify in just a few minutes. Migrating your local library has never been easier!\\n\\n## Before you start (5 minutes)\\n\\n*This isn\\'t infalible, and it would be quite surprising if it matched 100% of songs. Be aware you\\'ll probably have to do **a bit** of manual searching, but this will significantly reduce that amount by automating the majority of the process.*\\n\\nOn to the requirements and instructions:\\n\\n### Install Python >3.6\\n\\nMake sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed, preferably the latest version. We tested it with Python 3.8.4 on a x64 PC with Windows 10\\nYou\\'ll need to install the libraries `spotipy` and `eyed3`\\n\\nI suggest you create a virtual environment so you don\\'t mess other libraries, with the built in `venv`\\n\\n### Using venv (OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED)\\n\\nFor this, simply open a Terminal in the folder that the code is in (type \\'wt\\' in the Windows Explorer address bar for Windows Terminal, or \\'cmd\\' if that doesn\\'t work)\\nand write the following commands (make sure to change <MyEnv> for your desired folder name):\\n\\n```python\\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\\npython -m venv <MyEnv>\\n<MyEnv>\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.bat # <- on cmd\\n<MyEnv>\\\\Scripts\\\\Activate.ps1 # <- on PowerShell\\n```\\n\\nThis should make the terminal look something like this:\\n\\n![Terminal with venv active](https://imgur.com/1jWhGhU.png)\\n\\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` and press Enter. It is not necessary, though, as we\\'ll be working within the environment and you can just close the console once it is done.\\n\\n### Installing the libraries\\n\\nYou can now install `spotipy`, `tinytag` and `eyed3` with:\\n\\n```python\\npip install -r .\\\\requirements.txt\\n```\\nor\\n```python\\npip install --upgrade spotipy\\npip install -U eyed3\\npip install -U tinytag\\n```\\n\\n### Creating a Spotify Developer Application\\n\\nHead over to [the Spotify Developer website](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), log in with your Spotify account and create a new application (name doesn\\'t matter).\\n\\nCopy the `client id` and the `client secret`, open the settings and make sure to add a URL to the \"Redirect URIs\". It doesn\\'t really matter what, try https://localhost/ if not sure, but take note of it because you\\'ll need to write it in the source code later.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lwFiRh9.png)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OerZP5c.jpg)\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z3DIPZf.jpg)\\n\\nWith these 3, open the file `main.py` with whatever IDE or Text Editor you like (preferably Notepad++, Wordpad or TextEdit if you use a text editor), and change this bit of code:\\n\\n![connect_to_spotify code](https://imgur.com/ltblD1T.png)\\n\\n(Use the Find function to find it if you don\\'t see it. It is inside the `connect_to_spotify` function)\\n\\nPaste the aforementioned ids and the URL you chose in the corresponding lines. With this, setup is done and you can now use the tool!\\n\\n## Using SpotifyMatcher\\n\\nUsage is very, very simple. You only have to call the program from a Terminal of your choice with\\n```\\npython ./main.py username playlist_id\\n```\\n(may have to use `python3` if you have several versions of Python installed or if you\\'re not on Windows).\\n\\nWith this, the application should open a new tab on your default browser. Accept the permissions it asks for, and copy the URL of the page it takes you to (if it\\'s localhost, it will probably not load anything, that\\'s perfectly ok. We only need the URL). Paste it in the terminal.\\n\\nWith that, authentication should be done and you can move on to the *good stuff*. Simply paste the path to your music directory (Tip: right click the address bar on Windows Explorer, \\'Copy address as text\\'). **You can also bypass this step** if you manually enter a path in the source code. Simply find the `music_dir` variable and paste it there before you execute the program:\\n\\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/mZGFs6d.png)\\n\\nIf the path is valid, the program should start identifying your files and subsequently searching Spotify for a match. This may take several minutes, depending on your processor, internet speed, number of files... Just be patient!\\n\\nOnce done, if you specified a `playlist_id` it will try to add the matches to said playlist.\\n#### ***CAREFUL***\\nIf you don\\'t own said playlist, can\\'t add tracks or it has been deleted, **the program will fail, and you\\'ll have to start again**, so make sure you have said permissions.\\n\\n\\nWe recommend either leaving it blank, so the program creates a new one for you or creating a new playlist and getting its id (simply open it in the browser and copy the final string of numbers and letters).\\n\\nOnly thing left is to check the .txt file with the failed matches and search those manually (I know, I know... blame Spotify\\'s inconsistent artist - title debacle!)\\n\\n## Getting your username and playlist ids\\n### Username\\nOpen Spotify on PC, go to your user profile and click the 3 dots. Click share and \"Copy Spotify URI\". Paste and remove the `spotify:user:`\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/TS6ZZlV.png)\\n\\nYou can also copy your profile link and just take the stuff after `/user` but before the `?`\\n\\n### Playlist id\\nWe recommend you don\\'t actually use a playlist id and rather leave it blank so the program creates one for you automatically, but if you insist, simply open the playlist, click the 3 dots > Share > Copy Spotify URI. As with the username, remove the `spotify:playlist:`.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can simply copy the playlist link and just take the final string of numbers and letters. Same thing.\\n'},\n",

The automation is powered by [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and executes automatically on Mondays as defined in the [save.yaml](/.github/workflows/save.yaml).\\n\\n## Initial Set Up (approx: 10 minutes)\\nYou should not need to make any commits back to the repo. The files in [/setup](/setup) will help obtain the authorization information for setting up the environment variables in github secrets in order to allow `main.py` to execute properly. You need to fork this repo in order to have your own instance of github actions.\\n\\n### (1) Create a Fork\\nStart off with simple fork by clicking on the \"Fork\" button. Once you\\'ve done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or use the command line:\\n```bash\\n# Clone your fork to your local machine\\n$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spotify-save-discover-weekly.git\\n```\\n\\n### (2) Librairies\\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all of the required librairies. You could use this with a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) if required. \\n```bash\\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n### (3) Spotify API Credentials\\n1. Open the `.sample.env` file from the [/setup](/setup) folder on your local machine. \\n2. Sign into your [Spotify API Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new application. You can use any uri for the redirect uri, this is the base uri you will be redirected to after authorizing the app to access your account. If you see a \"INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI\", then edit settings of your app from the spotify dashboard and add your uri as a redirect uri.\\n3. Fill out the env file with the same Client ID, Secret and Redirect URI details used in step 2 and save this file as `.env`. **Do not post these details anywhere publically.**\\n\\nExample:\\n```\\nCLIENT_ID=thisisanid\\nCLIENT_SECRET=thisisasecret\\nREDIRECT_URI=https://your.url/here\\n```\\n5. Execute [authorization.py](/setup/authorization.py) and open the URL generated. \\n6. Authorize your app to access your Spotify account, this will then redirect you to your Redirect URI with a `?code=` parameter in the url.\\n7. Copy the whole url you were redirected to into the console and hit enter, this will then give you your refresh token. **Do not post this refresh token anywhere publically.**\\n\\nExample:\\n ```\\n$python authorization.py\\nOpen this link in your browser: https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=thisisanid&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRegsonDR&scope=user-library-read+playlist-modify-public+playlist-modify-private+playlist-read-private+playlist-read-collaborative\\n\\nEnter URL you was redirected to (after accepting authorization):\\n> https://your.url/here?code=somecodehere\\n\\nYour refresh token is: somerefreshtokenhere\\n```\\n\\n### (4) Github Actions\\n1. Go to the settings of your forked repo and click on secrets. \\n2. You will need to create the following secrets:\\n  *  **CLIENT_ID** - Use the same Client ID from your `.env`.\\n  *  **CLIENT_SECRET** - Use the same Client Secret from your `.env`\\n  *  **REFRESH_TOKEN** - Use the refresh token generated in the [(3) Spotify API Credentials](#3-spotify-api-credentials) instructions above.\\n  *  **DISCOVER_WEEKLY_ID** - This is the ID of your Discover Weekly playlist, which can obtained using the [method](#obtaining-spotify-playlist-ids) described below.\\n  *  **SAVE_TO_ID** - This is the ID of your permanent playlist, which can be obtained using the [method](#obtaining-spotify-playlist-ids) described below. You will need to create a new playlist or use an existing playlist if there is somewhere you would like to already save the songs into.\\n\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32569720/113211160-0a7d3380-926d-11eb-97bc-0e17ef911336.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Obtaining Spotify Playlist IDs\\n1. Right click on a playlist > \"Share\" > Copy the Spotify URI (`spotify:playlist:c11M5VLWLMh66yW4gsl51S`). \\n2. The ID is of this playlist is `c11M5VLWLMh66yW4gsl51S`, use this for the environment variable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Manual Execution via Github Actions\\n1. Go to Actions in your forked repo.\\n2. Click on \"Save songs\"\\n3. Click on \"Run workflow\" which will bring up a drop down menu.\\n4. Click on \"Run Workflow\" again, this will initiate the script. Within the next few minutes, the script should execute and your songs should be in your new playlist in spotify.\\n\\nAny execution errors can be found from within the actions tab of your forked repo.\\n\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32569720/113211386-4fa16580-926d-11eb-94c9-ddb513a122a7.png)\\n\\n## Local Execution \\nAlternatively, you can store the **REFRESH_TOKEN**, **DISCOVER_WEEKLY_ID** & **SAVE_TO_ID** back into your `.env` file and execute `main.py` on your machine when required, maybe manually or using a task schedular. Make sure to have the `.env` and `main.py` files in the same directory for this.\\n\\n ```\\n$python main.py\\n```\\n---\\n\\n## Contributing\\nPull requests are welcome.

       "  'readme_contents': '# Maestro\\n\\n<img src=\"./roboto.png\" width=270/>\\n\\nA Slack-Powered music bot for Spotify, using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) and [shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify).\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThe first thing you\\'ll need to run Maestro is a computer to run it from. It\\'ll need to be running\\n**OSX, with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed**. It\\'ll also need **Ruby**, which comes\\npre-installed with OSX, so you should be good there. Lastly, but most importantly, this computer\\nis the one that will be playing the music, so it\\'ll either need\\n**good speakers, or a headphone jack** to plug a sound system into.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got a computer to run it on, you can install Maestro by running the following commands\\nin a terminal:\\n\\n```sh\\nbrew install shpotify\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/smashingboxes/maestro.git\\ncd maestro\\nbundle install\\n```\\n\\n### Connecting to Spotify\\'s api\\n\\nshpotify needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by\\nname. It is very likely you want this feature!\\n\\nTo get this to work, you first need to sign up (or into) Spotify’s\\ndeveloper site and [create an *Application*][spotify-dev]. Once you’ve\\ndone so, you can find its `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values and\\nenter them into your shpotify config file at `${HOME}/.shpotify.cfg`.\\n\\nBe sure to quote your values and don’t add any extra spaces. When\\ndone, it should look like the following (but with your own values):\\n\\n```sh\\nCLIENT_ID=\"abc01de2fghijk345lmnop\"\\nCLIENT_SECRET=\"qr6stu789vwxyz\"\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n```sh\\nruby app.rb\\n```\\n\\nThis will start up Maestro on port 4567. To use it with Slack, you\\'ll want to configure an external\\nURL (see \"Obtaining an external URL\" below), and set up a slash command (see \"Creating a slash\\ncommand\" below).\\n\\nOnce that\\'s done, you can interact with it via any command\\n[shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) supports. Here are the most common commands:\\n\\n```\\n/maestro play <song name>\\n/maestro next\\n/maestro vol up\\n/maestro vol down\\n/maestro status\\n```\\n\\n## Configuring Slack\\n\\n### Obtaining an external URL\\n\\nThere are many ways to get an external URL or static IP. The easiest is to use [ngrok]():\\n\\n```sh\\nbrew cask install ngrok\\nngrok http 4567\\n```\\n\\nIn the output, ngrok will provide you with an external url such as `http://71ca42f4.ngrok.io`,\\nyou\\'ll need that for the next section.\\n\\n**NOTE: If ngrok gets restarted (during a computer restart, for example), a new URL will be\\ngenerated. You\\'ll need to update your slash command (created in the next section) with the\\nnew one.**\\n\\n### Creating a slash command\\n\\nTo create a slash command in Slack, go to https://slack.com/apps/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands, click \"Add Configuration\", and fill in the following settings:\\n\\n- Command: \"/maestro\"\\n- URL: Your external URL (from previous section), followed by `/maestro`. So, for example, if your ngrok url is `http://71ca42f4.ngrok.io`, you\\'d enter `http://71ca42f4.ngrok.io/maestro`\\n- Method: POST\\n- Customize Name: Maestro\\n- Customize Icon: Any icon you\\'d like. Feel free to use [ours](./maestro.png)\\n- Autocomplete help text:\\n  - Check \"Show this command in the autocomplete list\"\\n  - Description: https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify\\n  - Usage hint: [shpotify command]\\n'},\n",

In this classification the \\n[sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) implementations of \\n[logistic regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) and \\n[random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) are used alongside [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\\nto classify if a track should be considered to be added to the set of favourite playlists.\\n\\nAlthough the traditional approach can yield good recommendations, it is heavily reliant on both feature engineering \\nand there being enough features which cover user tastes (which is unlikely for subjective items such as movies and songs).\\nAs this approach reliant on users define their favourites (classification) or to accurately score songs \\n(regression), it suffers from both mislabelling inaccuracies and the cold-start problem when a user has a fresh account \\nor doesn\\'t provide any ratings. Hence recommender system approaches are applied in [recommender_systems.ipynb](recommender_systems.ipynb).\\n\\n### Model Evaluation Metric\\n\\nHere we use the Top-N accuracy metric (in this case Top-100), which applies a recommender system to a dataset of 1 user \\ninteracted item and 100 uninteracted items. The perfect recommender system will rank the user interacted item first \\n(highest recommendation strength). This is computed for each item for each user, and then the weighted mean is taken\\nacross all users to get a global metric. The metric \\'recall@5\\' for each user is the number of times the interacted item\\nwas in the Top-5 items / the number of times it wasn\\'t.\\n\\n### Popularity Recommender\\n\\nA popularity recommender recommends songs ranked by their popularity regardless of user\\'s preferences. This is of course\\ndependent upon the methodology used to determine the popularity metric (usually some function of time, user interactions,\\nand user ratings).\\n\\n```\\'recall@5\\': 0.09318497913769123, \\'recall@10\\': 0.17385257301808066```\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/popularity.png\" alt=\"popularity\" width=\"500\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\nAs it doesn\\'t take user activity into account, solely recommending by popularity is a poor way to \\nrecommend tracks. However, as we will see later it is a good method to mix in for variety and to avoid the cold-start problem.\\n\\n### Content-based Recommender\\n\\nA content-based recommender leverages attributes from items the user has interacted with to recommend similar items. \\nHere the popular [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) method is used to convert unstructured text \\n(unigrams and bigrams of genres and song/artist/album/playlist name) into a sparse matrix , \\nwhich is then summed and normalized across users to give a vector structure, where each word is represented\\nby a position in the vector and the value measures its relevance. The cosine similarity between the \\nuser vector and the initial matrix (all users) then gives a metric to recommend new tracks.\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/tfidf_tokens.png\" alt=\"tfidf_tokens\" width=\"150\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\n```\\'recall@5\\': 0.9123783031988874, \\'recall@10\\': 0.972183588317107```\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/content.png\" alt=\"content\" width=\"500\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\nA very high recall is observed as the dataset used considers each playlist (which tend to be heavily genre/mood based)\\nas a user. Hence the content-based recommender performs exceedingly well by the Top-N metric but fails to give much variety.\\n\\n### Collaborative Recommender\\n\\nA collaborative recommender can be either memory-based (based on past user interactions) or model-based (e.g. clustering).\\nHere [matrix factorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)) implemented\\nvia [singular value decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) is used to compress\\na user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation. This yields better scalability and better generalisation.\\nThe items x users matrix is then used to recommend items to users based on similar user interactions.\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/matrix_factorisation.png\" alt=\"matrix_factorisation\" width=\"400\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\n```\\'recall@5\\': 0.23783031988873435, \\'recall@10\\': 0.30737134909596664```\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/collaborative.png\" alt=\"collaborative\" width=\"500\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\nThe collaborative approach outperforms the popularity approach but is not a good as the content-based approach. It can \\nsuffer from the sparsity problem if the user set is too small or the number of interactions is too low.\\n\\n### Hybrid Recommender\\n\\nA hybrid recommender combines the content-based and collaborative approaches and has been shown to perform better in \\nmany studies. It avoids high variance and enables variety and weighting (e.g. genre weighting). As the content-based\\napproach performs better by the Top-N metric is is weighed more strongly here.\\n\\n```\\'recall@5\\': 0.9068150208623088, \\'recall@10\\': 0.9666203059805285```\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/hybrid.png\" alt=\"hybrid\" width=\"500\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\nThis weighting approach has the same issue as the content-based recommender - too much weighting on genre and not\\nenough variety. Here the popularity approach is also now incorporated with a weighting to give a hybrid + popularity recommender. \\n\\n```\\'recall@5\\': 0.6244784422809457, \\'recall@10\\': 0.7343532684283728```\\n\\n<p align=\"left\">\\n    <img src=\"results/hybrid_popularity.png\" alt=\"hybrid_popularity\" width=\"500\"/>  \\n</p>\\n\\nEven though it has a lower recall, subjectively this recommender appears to give the best recommendations in practice.\\nIt may therefore be better to incorporate other evaluation metrics such as one that measures variety, \\nor increase the scope of this dataset as its current playlist based approach means that pure genre-based \\nrecommendations perform the best.\\n\\n### Future Work\\n\\n- Expand the dataset to include other users (rather than proxying playlists as users)\\n- Develop other evaluation metrics (although this is somewhat solved by expanding the dataset)\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n1. Access the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)\\n2. Setup your project including the project settings (I used http://localhost:9001/callback as the redirect URI)\\n3.

You don\\'t need an appkey to use these, but you still need a Spotify Premium account.\\n\\n## Building ##\\n\\n1. Clone Viva using `git clone --recursive git://github.com/iKenndac/Viva.git` to make sure you get all the submodules too.\\n2. If you got excited and cloned the repo before reading this, run `git submodule update --init` in the Viva directory to grab the submodules. If I get tickets about it not building and you haven\\'t got the submodules checked out, you lose 5 internet points!\\n3. Supply an appkey.c file (see above).\\n4. Build away!\\n\\n## Interesting Areas ##\\n\\nViva has been made in my hackday and spare time, which has resulting in the code being rather... scattered. However, there are some nice examples of various Mac OS X technologies in there. A few of my favourites:\\n\\nCore Data over multiple threads: `LocalFileSource.m`.\\n\\nCore Audio Graphs, including a Graphic EQ: `SPCoreAudioController.m`.\\n\\nUsing AVFoundation to get media file metadata: `LocalFileSource.m`, `-parseMediaFileAtPath:intoContext:`.\\n\\nUsing AVFoundation to convert audio files to PCM data for manual playback through Core Audio: `VivaAVAssetDecoderWorker.m`.\\n\\nUsing FSEvents to watch a directory tree for changes: `LocalFileSource.m`.\\n\\nUsing libFLAC to get FLAC metadata: `LocalFileSource+LocalFileSourceFLACAdditions.m`.\\n\\nUsing libFLAC to decode FLAC files for playback: `VivaFLACDecoderWorker.m`.\\n\\n'},\n",

If no playback is active, the bot changes the bio back to the original one from the user.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nThis script will do an interactive setup the first time you run bot.py. If you want to do it by yourself, you can follow the steps below, but that isn\\'t necessary anymore.\\n\\nJust remember to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\\n\\nDepreciated manual steps:\\n\\n0. Ensure you have python 3.6+ installed and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\\n1. Get your spotify client_id and your client_secret from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/. If you need more help, have a look [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app). Set a Rediret URI to http://localhost:1234/callback\\n2. Get your telegram app api_id and api_hash from https://my.telegram.org/. If you need more help, have a look [here](https://telethon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extra/basic/creating-a-client.html#creating-a-client).\\n3. If you want to have a log channel or group or so, paste its invite link or id in the LOG variable. If you leave it at \"me\", you will see those in your saved chat. Only if errors occur ofc ;)\\n4. Paste all these values in their respective variables at [constants.py](/constants.py). While you are at it, you can also paste an initial biography there. Just take your current one. This is highly recommended. If you don\\'t do this **and** have a currently playing track, the bot has at its first start no idea what your original biography is. Just do it, please.\\n5. You are going to generate a token here which is only valid for a short amount of time, so be sure to run generate.py quickly after this. Open the following link (change CLIENT_ID to you client_id): https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:1234/callback&scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-read-currently-playing\\n6. After you grant permission, you get redirected to https://example.com/callback?code=_. Copy everything after the code, this is you initial token.\\n7. Now you can run [generate.py](/generate.py). This will generate a json file named database.\\n8. You are almost done. If you now run [bot.py](/bot.py), all you need to do is log into your telegram account. Follow the instructions on screen.\\n9. Now you are really done.\\n\\n## Important Information\\n\\nYou can shut the bot down if you want/need to. Write `//stop` anywhere you want. If you want to change the command, edit SHUTDOWN_COMMAND in the [constants](/constants.py).\\n\\n## Warning\\n\\nThis bot uses the emoji 🎶 to determine if the current bio is an active spotify biography or not. This means you mustn\\'t use this emoji on your original biographies or the bot will probably break. Don\\'t do it, thanks.\\n\\n## But I want to\\n\\nGreat news. Just change the KEY variable in [constants](/constants.py) file. Don\\'t ever use your new KEY in your biographies though!\\n\\n## Issues? Need help? Want to tell me something?\\n\\nWell, just create an issue here. You can also ping me on [telegram](https://t.me/poolitzer).\\n'},\n",

Inspired by [spotify2am](https://github.com/simonschellaert/spotify2am) am which didn't work for me :D\\n\\n### [Downwload DMG](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/SpotifyImporter.dmg)\\n\\n\\n[![](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen1.png)](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen1.png)\\n\\n## Why ?\\nI created this project before [@maciej's Playlist Importer](https://lupin.rocks/entry/seamlessly-import-your-spotify-playlists-into-itunes) show up, i am iOS developer and i wanted to try OS X development. Disadvantage of @maciej's Playlist Importer is that you have to leave your Mac for a some time and it can't import your songs in background. This project disadvantage it that you have to sniff iTunes packet to get your account identifiers and cookie but it works in background!\\n\\n# Usage\\n\\n## 1. Export from Spotify and import to SpotiyImporter\\n\\n1. Export the Spotify URIs\\n\\nYou can copy as many as you want, but remember - only single track URIs are supported. This is how it should look like:\\n\\n[![](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen2.png)](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen2.png)\\n\\n2. Export the Spotify songs to an CSV File\\n\\nThe first step is getting the songs you want to import into Apple Music into a CSV file. The simplest way to do this is using [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html).\\nIf you want to export you whole Spotify library, simply create a new playlist called All and drag your whole library into it using the Spotify desktop app. You can then export the playlist All using Exportify. Save the resulting file as spotify.csv in the same directory as the directory you cloned this repo into.\\n\\n## 2. Use an intercepting proxy to retrieve the Apple Music request headers\\n\\nWe are going to retrieve cookie data from iTunes using Charles Proxy.\\n\\n1. From the Menu Proxy go to SSL Proxy Settings\\n\\n2. Check 'Enable SSL Proxying'\\n\\n3. Click on add and insert '*itunes.apple.com'\\n\\n4. In the same Menu check on 'Mac OS X Proxy'\\n\\n5. Go to iTunes go to an Apple Music playlist but don't do nothing\\n\\n6. Check you have enabled recording (please refer to image below)\\n\\n7. When recording is enabled add the playlist to my Music\\n\\n[![](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen3_thumb.png)](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen3.png)\\n\\nApplication simply compares the title and artist to find out if a Spotify and Apple Music song match, additionaly if some of this didn't match i am calculating matching score based on title of song. Some songs don't have the exact same title (extraneous spacing for example) in both services.\\n\"},\n",

It helps reducing number of items to render, hence there is significant performance boost if you have a large playlists collection. But the drawbacks is that item height is hard-coded, it messes up user interaction when we explicitly change, in CSS, playlist item height bigger than original value. So you need to add these 2 lines in Patch section in config file:\\r\\n```ini\\r\\n[Patch]\\r\\nxpui.js_find_8008 = ,(\\\\w+=)32,\\r\\nxpui.js_repl_8008 = ,${1}58,\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Hide Window Controls\\r\\nWindows user, please edit your Spotify shortcut and add flag `--transparent-window-controls` after the Spotify.exe:\\r\\nTo edit a taskbar shortcut, right click it, then right click Spotify in the list again.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/main/showcase-images/windows-shortcut-instruction.png\" alt=\"img\"> \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to `--transparent-window-controls` you can set `Windows Top Bars` to `Solid` or `Transparent` to look like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/main/showcase-images/top-bars.png\" alt=\"img\" width=\"500px\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n## Follow system dark/light theme (Powershell)\\r\\nAutomatic dark mode should work on MacOs and Linux out of the box.\\r\\nFrom Spotify > v1.1.70, dark mode is forced in Windows builds. You will need to patch Spotify.exe using this script:\\r\\n```powershell\\r\\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/master/patch-dark-mode.ps1\" | Invoke-Expression\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Uninstall\\r\\n### Windows (PowerShell)\\r\\n```powershell\\r\\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/master/uninstall.ps1\" | Invoke-Expression\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Linux/MacOS (Bash)\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/master/uninstall.sh | sh\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Manual Uninstall\\r\\n1.

Therefore, I don\\'t see the point in using this.\"\\n\\nHow rude!\\nAs you might have noticed, this is an open source project, which means that you can add or suggest your own features.\\nOf course, don\\'t expect us to ever have a method such as `getTaylorSwiftBestTracks` pushed into our master branch.\\n(But if you ever thought on something like that, hey, let\\'s be friends!)\\n\\nWhat we really mean is: there\\'s a lot of information that can be extracted from the data retrievable via Spotify\\'s Web API.\\nIf you think of something that could come in handy for you and also other people, that\\'s it! Don\\'t be shy, make it happen.\\nWe\\'ll gladly review your suggestion as soon as possible!\\n\\nFor instance, you can retrieve the duration of a track in milliseconds straight from the API, but know what\\'d more usual?\\nIf you thought \"displaying it in minutes\", we\\'re on the same page.\\nTo do that, adding the following code to our Track model would do the trick:\\n\\n```javascript\\nget formattedDuration() {\\n    const minutes = Math.floor(this.durationMs / 60000);\\n    const seconds = Math.floor((this.durationMs % 60000) / 1000);\\n    return `${minutes}:${seconds < 10 ? \\'0\\' : \\'\\'}${seconds}`;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis is already implemented, but do you get our point?\\nIt might be something really simple, but we believe that such little things can save a lot of time in the future.\\n\\n### \"You convinced me.

       "  'readme_contents': '# Spotify Clone App Authenication Server\\nThis repository is the code to run an authorization/authentication server to connect to the Spotify API. The server is to be used in conjunction with the front-end code of the cloned app found [here](https://github.com/JL978/spotify-clone-client)\\n\\n## Motivation\\nWhen working with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), you must follow this authorization [guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) provided on the API documentation. The basis of this authorization flow involve using a client id and client secret provided by signing up on the Spotify Developer dash board. These keys must be sent with every single request made to the Spotify server. \\n\\nWhen working with a client secret, one must keep it... well secret. Therefore, the solution to this is to keep the requests to the Spotify API on the server-side so that the client-side app can\\'t expose the secret key to potential attackers - making the app more secure. Authenitcation of users are also done through this server for the same purpose and a refresh_token is sent back as a cookie while an access token is sent back to be stored in memory. This authorization flow was built to avoid the most common types of cyber attack - Cross Site Scripting and Cross Site Request Forgery.\\n\\n## Tech/Framework Used\\n* Node.js\\n* Express.js\\n* axios\\n\\n## Installation\\nThis project requires [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed globally. \\n\\nClone the repository to a directory of your choosing\\n\\n```sh\\n$ git clone https://github.com/JL978/spotify-clone-server.git\\n```\\nNavigate into spotify-clone-server and install the necessary packages\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install \\n```\\nTo run the server\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm start\\n```\\nTo run the dev server\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm run dev\\n```\\n\\n### **Other requirements**\\n[The Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)\\n\\nCreate a new .env file in the root folder and add the following key value pairs to the file\\n\\n```sh\\nCLIENT_ID = [client id optained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard]\\nCLIENT_SECRET = [client secret optained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard]\\nFRONT_URI = http://localhost:3000\\nRE_URI = http://localhost:4000/callback\\nREXP = /\\\\.localhost:3000/\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThis server is to be consumed by a front-end application - namely the Spotify clone at this [repo](https://github.com/JL978/spotify-clone-client)\\n\\nThe following endpoints are available\\n\\n|Endpoint|Method|Body|Response|\\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|\\n|/|POST|{endpoint}|200 with the returned data from the endpoint|\\n|/login|GET|none|redirect to the Spotify authentication page|\\n|/refresh_token|GET|none|if a valid refresh token is available in the cookie, an access_token is sent back as data|\\n|/logout|GET|none|clear the refresh token and effectively log the user out off the app|\\n\\n## The architecture\\n### Client Credential Flow (un-authorized requests)\\n\\n![client credential flow](demo/unauthed.png)\\n\\nThe advantage of doing request this way instead of using the implicit grant flow as outlined in the Spotify API document is that you have a higher rate limit. It also doesn\\'t prompt the user to login, which would be a bad experience for users who don\\'t have a Spotify account but just want to browse their selections. \\n\\nAn improvement to this process would be to store the access_token in memory after the first request and use that for subsequent requests instead of requesting for a new access token on every request.\\n\\n### Authorization code flow \\n\\nThe majority of code flow is very similar to the authorization code flow as outlined in the API [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/), a diagram of which is shown bellow\\n\\n![spotify authorization flow](demo/spotify-auth.png)\\n\\nThe only difference with this server is that the sent back data at step 2 is the access_token as JSON so that the client can store that in memory (the client will now show the logged in version of the app) and set the refresh token in a cookie. At this point the client is free to make requests for personal data as outlined in step 3-4 however an issue would arise if the user refreshed the page. Since the access_token is stored in memory, the user would be logged out during page refresh and provide a bad user experience. To solve this issue, a /refresh_token endpoint is also provided. During any initial loading, the client checks for if their is a refresh_token stored in a cookie, if there is then it makes a request to the /refresh_token endpoint which uses the refresh_token to obtain a new access_key from the Spotify API. \\n\\n![refresh token flow](demo/refresh.png)\\n\\n### Logging out\\n\\nSince \"logged in\" just means that there is a refresh_token stored in cookies, to log the user out it is simply deleting the cookie and refresh the client.\\n'},\n",

This will be solved in the upcoming version as we go into more complicated database system.\\n- ~~While a track(/s) is getting downloaded from a particular playlist, if user exists the screen or another playlist is loaded, then the download gets cancelled.~~\\n- Few playlist may give error unexpectedly.\\n- Due to youtube policies, few songs are not downloadable. This is because some videos are regionally restriced or so. [See these limitations](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core#limitations)\\n- Youtube server gives `429 error`.\\n- Downloads wrong tracks\\n- If you encounter anything else, feel free to report an issue or DM me.

The Helper is used to launch Reign on startup;\\n* There are build schemes for App Store and Non App Store distribution;\\n* Some code (like the preferences window) differs between App Store and Non App Store (mainly because of Sparkle);\\n* The Server opens a http socket using CocoaHTTPServer, broadcasts it using Bonjour and feeds commands to Spotify using AppleScript;\\n* The Client uses CocoAsyncSocket looks around for other Reign servers;\\n* Comments are minimal, sorry, might fix that later.\\n\\n## Things you need to add\\n\\n* The App Store build uses [Receigen](http://receigen.etiemble.com/) for receipt validation, remove the build step and code in main.m if you don't have it;\\n* Related to Receigen, this repo relies on a statically linked OpenSSL library. Clear the `User Header Search Path` to remove it.\\n* The dsa_pub.pem file for Sparkle is obviously missing.\\n\\n# Purpose and pull-requests\\n\\n* For me, this is a pet project, but we'll try our best to merge additions to our code;\\n* Bug-fixes and other stuff I can learn from are awesome;\\n* New features are great.\\n\\n# Credits\\n\\nRobbie Hanson - [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)\\n\\nRobbie Hanson - [CocoaHTTPServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer)\\n\\nRobbie Hanson - [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaLumberjack)\\n\\nAhmet Ardal - [DisableSubviews](https://github.com/ardalahmet/DisableSubviews)\\n\\nVadim Shpakovski - [MASPreferences](https://github.com/shpakovski/MASPreferences)\\n\\nDavid Keegan - [LaunchAtLoginHelper](https://github.com/kgn/LaunchAtLoginHelper)\\n\\nAndy Matuschak - [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/)\\n\\n# Contributors\\n\\nBoy van Amstel - [boyvanamstel](https://github.com/boyvanamstel)\\n\\nDan Gilbert - [daentech](https://github.com/daentech)\\n\\n# License for the rest of it\\n\\nNew BSD License, see `LICENSE` for details.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': '# spotify-ripper-web\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis repository aimed to create an easy-to-use web interface for the spotify-ripper. Archiving this goal I had the following point in the back of my head:\\n\\n- Parallel downloads of multiple users\\n\\nSo I decided on the following project structure:\\n\\nspotify-ripper-docker:\\n- This is just a dockerized version of the spotify-ripper, including some adjustments to better handle the standard data streams and bring them to the web interface.\\n\\nspotify-ripper-web-backend:\\n- This is a node.js application which communicates with the frontend via websockets.\\n- It creates and starts new containers and forwards the standard data streams to the UI via Websocket.\\n\\nspotify-ripper-web-frontend:\\n- This is a vue.js spa, communicating with the node.js backend; Here you can also finally download the music.\\n\\n## Things that aren\\'t so beautiful:\\n\\n- The project actually consists of three projects, which would probably have been much more intelligent to separate.\\n- No TDD; not even the vue.js project\\n- Implemented the spotify-ripper as a zip file; this would also be a separate project...\\n- Not as much use of environment vars as I should have; there are some things hardcoded, like the websocket port\\n- Not the worst and ugliest code; but alsonot the cleanest one..\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThe installation should be quite simple by dockerization.\\n\\n### Prequesites\\n\\n1. Installing docker and docker-compose\\n2. rename `.env.example` to `.env` and change the path according tr environment.\\n3. add your `spotify_appkey.key` to the `spotify-ripper-docker` folder\\n4. (adjust `docker-compose.yml` to mount your docker.sock)\\n\\n### Run the application\\n\\nTo do this you can simply run `docker-compose up --build` (Depending on how you configured Docker, sudo may be required)\\n    \\nFYI: This whole repo is optimized and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.\\n    \\nIf all went well, it should look something like this: (remember that port 3000 is in the container and mapped outside by your adjustments in the `docker-compose.yml`)\\n    \\n![Console](/screenshots/screenshot_1.png \"Console\")\\n    \\nThen you should be able to access it by `http://localhost:<your_port>/web/`\\n\\n## Screenshots\\n\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_2.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_3.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_4.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_5.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\n'},\n",

Even still, Discord might remove this feature from time to time to update it since canary is a development version of Discord.**\\n\\n  Q: Can I host this on an external server?  \\n  A: **No, the Discord RPC api runs on your local Discord client, and unless you want to port forward a few things and create necessary firewall rules to do it, it\\'s not worth it. You\\'d have to repeat that with the Spotify web helper api, too.**\\n\\n  Q: I\\'m not experienced with this scope of programming, are there any tutorials?  \\n  A: **Yes!

If not, create a new one with the WHOLE error and when it occurred (during start, runtime, etc).

       "  'readme_contents': '# Spotify Manipulation with Python; can a Data Scientist Replace a DJ?\\n\\n[Originally published on Medium via the Towards Data Science [publication](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-a-data-scientist-replace-a-dj-spotify-manipulation-with-python-fbbd4a45ffd5)]\\n\\n## Introduction\\nData Science is vast and continuously expands into new industries, offering a multitude of valuable (corporate mainly) applications. The music industry is one of them. Should we treat any of those applications like a \"black box\", we would observe an input (data) and an output (product).\\n\\n## Scope\\nThis project aims to manipulate the Spotify music data with Python, having a twofold scope:\\n\\n✔️ proving that the existence of an API (Application Programming Interface) is of high importance, in terms of feeding algorithms with extra fine data.\\n\\n✔️ demonstrating how plain statistics (when properly applied) can encode daily actions, break them down into their fundamental elements and on top of them build valuable products.\\n\\n## Scenario\\n\\nLately, the Data Corp I work for as a data scientist, records remarkable profits from their Youth Marketing segment and in reward for this, it rewards its young customers with a party. In the absence of a DJ, my supervisor asked me to take care of the music and make the party last until the morning! She gave to me a number of Spotify playlists, the PR department had already created, in order to check them out and create the final one. My blindness to the modern music generally, leads me to a tricky alternative:\\n\\n*How about accessing all the playlists using Python, extracting every single audio feature of each track, reason about them statistically and wrapping  the most suitable (to our party) tracks to a final playlist? Given of course a technicality: I am not going to hear a single beat of any of them!*\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nWe make requests to the Spotify API for data collection, using the free Python libraries, Spotipy and Requests. We access the user playlists, tracks and perform EDA on their audio features, using Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib. A number of data visualizations are depicted, to better communicate the results. Finally, we create the final playlist of tracks.\\n\\n## Authorization Flow Guide\\n\\n1. Sign up at Spotify for Developers at https://developer.spotify.com/ and select \"Create an app\". Write down your \\'Client ID\\' and \\'Client Secret\\'. While in the \"Dashboard\", select the \"Edit settings\" menu and in the \"Redirect URIs\" field fill the: http://localhost:7777/callback.\\n2. Open Spotify_Data_Manipulation_Python.ipynb and in the Authorization Flow code block, insert your Spotify username, Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI as `cid`, `secret`, `redirect_uri` and `username`, respectively.\\n3. Execute it. The first time Spotipy will need user authentication and will open a webpage, asking you to log in with your Spotify account and accept the permissions. After doing so, it will redirect you to a link. Copy the \\'Redirect URI\\' and paste in the field that will appear in the Notebook. Hit \\'enter\\'.\\n4. Now, you are connected to the Spotify API and capable to get your playlists ID, song IDs and use them to extract the features.\\n\\n## Additional Analysis\\nThere is quite a number of additional analyses to be performed, expanding this one. You are welcome to extend and shape yours in any direction you may prefer. For instance, you can additionally try and remove the tracks that have significantly low `danceability` and `valence` audio features, and boost even more the playlist\\'s `score`. Furthemore, you can apply each approach sequentially (on the dataframe that is produced each time).\\n\\n## Authors and Acknowledgement\\n[*It stands as an independent analysis in an effort to enhance my ability to communicate results, reason about data statistically and stay motivated to continuously implement newly aquired skills & capabilities, so as to enrich my portfolio of data science-oriented projects*]\\n- [@makispl](https://github.com/makispl) for concept & implementation.\\n- [@MPlegas](https://twitter.com/MPlegas) Twitter\\n- [@gerasimos_plegas](https://medium.com/@gerasimos_plegas) Medium\\n'},\n",

For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>\\nYou need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.\\n\\nOnly files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>\\nRead instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.\\n\\nYou can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>\\nThey will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.\\n\\n## Available Scripts\\n\\nIn the project directory, you can run:\\n\\n### `npm start`\\n\\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br>\\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\\n\\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br>\\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\\n\\n### `npm test`\\n\\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>\\nSee the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.\\n\\n### `npm run build`\\n\\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\\n\\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\\n\\nSee the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.\\n\\n### `npm run eject`\\n\\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**\\n\\nIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\\n\\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.\\n\\nYou don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.\\n\\n## Supported Language Features and Polyfills\\n\\nThis project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard.<br>\\nIn addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:\\n\\n* [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).\\n* [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).\\n* [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) (stage 3 proposal).\\n* [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 3 proposal)\\n* [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (stage 2 proposal).\\n* [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) syntax.\\n\\nLearn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).\\n\\nWhile we recommend to use experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.\\n\\nNote that **the project only includes a few ES6 [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)**:\\n\\n* [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) via [`object-assign`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign).\\n* [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) via [`promise`](https://github.com/then/promise).\\n* [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) via [`whatwg-fetch`](https://github.com/github/fetch).\\n\\nIf you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.\\n\\n## Syntax Highlighting in the Editor\\n\\nTo configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.\\n\\n## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.<br>\\n>It also only works with npm 3 or higher.\\n\\nSome editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.\\n\\nThey are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.\\n\\nYou would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first. Then, add a file called `.eslintrc` to the project root:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  \"extends\": \"react-app\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow your editor should report the linting warnings.\\n\\nNote that even if you edit your `.eslintrc` file further, these changes will **only affect the editor integration**. They won’t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.\\n\\nIf you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) instead of ESLint style rules.\\n\\n## Debugging in the Editor\\n\\n**This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.**\\n\\nVisual Studio Code supports debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.\\n\\nYou would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and VS Code [Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.\\n\\nThen add the block below to your `launch.json` file and put it inside the `.vscode` folder in your app’s root directory.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\\n  \"configurations\": [{\\n    \"name\": \"Chrome\",\\n    \"type\": \"chrome\",\\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\\n    \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}/src\",\\n    \"userDataDir\": \"${workspaceRoot}/.vscode/chrome\",\\n    \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\\n      \"webpack:///src/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\"\\n    }\\n  }]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nStart your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code—all from your editor.\\n\\n## Formatting Code Automatically\\n\\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, CSS and JSON. With Prettier you can format the code you write automatically to ensure a code style within your project. See the [Prettier\\'s GitHub page](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for more information, and look at this [page to see it in action](https://prettier.github.io/prettier/).\\n\\nTo format our code whenever we make a commit in git, we need to install the following dependencies:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save husky lint-staged prettier\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add husky lint-staged prettier\\n```\\n\\n* `husky` makes it easy to use githooks as if they are npm scripts.\\n* `lint-staged` allows us to run scripts on staged files in git. See this [blog post about lint-staged to learn more about it](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/make-linting-great-again-f3890e1ad6b8).\\n* `prettier` is the JavaScript formatter we will run before commits.\\n\\nNow we can make sure every file is formatted correctly by adding a few lines to the `package.json` in the project root.\\n\\nAdd the following line to `scripts` section:\\n\\n```diff\\n  \"scripts\": {\\n+   \"precommit\": \"lint-staged\",\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\n```\\n\\nNext we add a \\'lint-staged\\' field to the `package.json`, for example:\\n\\n```diff\\n  \"dependencies\": {\\n    // ...\\n  },\\n+ \"lint-staged\": {\\n+   \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css}\": [\\n+     \"prettier --single-quote --write\",\\n+     \"git add\"\\n+   ]\\n+ },\\n  \"scripts\": {\\n```\\n\\nNow, whenever you make a commit, Prettier will format the changed files automatically. You can also run `./node_modules/.bin/prettier --single-quote --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx}\"` to format your entire project for the first time.\\n\\nNext you might want to integrate Prettier in your favorite editor. Read the section on [Editor Integration](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration) on the Prettier GitHub page.\\n\\n## Changing the Page `<title>`\\n\\nYou can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from “React App” to anything else.\\n\\nNote that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) is done without touching the HTML.\\n\\nIf you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), a third party library.\\n\\nIf you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in [this section](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server). Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered [here](#pre-rendering-into-static-html-files).\\n\\n## Installing a Dependency\\n\\nThe generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save react-router\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add react-router\\n```\\n\\nThis works for any library, not just `react-router`.\\n\\n## Importing a Component\\n\\nThis project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.<br>\\nWhile you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n### `Button.js`\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { Component } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nclass Button extends Component {\\n  render() {\\n    // ...\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!\\n```\\n\\n### `DangerButton.js`\\n\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { Component } from \\'react\\';\\nimport Button from \\'./Button\\'; // Import a component from another file\\n\\nclass DangerButton extends Component {\\n  render() {\\n    return <Button color=\"red\" />;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport default DangerButton;\\n```\\n\\nBe aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.\\n\\nWe suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from \\'./Button\\'`.\\n\\nNamed exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.\\n\\nLearn more about ES6 modules:\\n\\n* [When to use the curly braces?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281)\\n* [Exploring ES6: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)\\n* [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)\\n\\n## Code Splitting\\n\\nInstead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.\\n\\nThis project setup supports code splitting via [dynamic `import()`](http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#loading-code-on-demand). Its [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is in stage 3. The `import()` function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n### `moduleA.js`\\n\\n```js\\nconst moduleA = \\'Hello\\';\\n\\nexport { moduleA };\\n```\\n### `App.js`\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { Component } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nclass App extends Component {\\n  handleClick = () => {\\n    import(\\'./moduleA\\')\\n      .then(({ moduleA }) => {\\n        // Use moduleA\\n      })\\n      .catch(err => {\\n        // Handle failure\\n      });\\n  };\\n\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\\n      </div>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n\\nThis will make `moduleA.js` and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the \\'Load\\' button.\\n\\nYou can also use it with `async` / `await` syntax if you prefer it.\\n\\n### With React Router\\n\\nIf you are using React Router check out [this tutorial](http://serverless-stack.com/chapters/code-splitting-in-create-react-app.html) on how to use code splitting with it. You can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-client/tree/code-splitting-in-create-react-app).\\n\\n## Adding a Stylesheet\\n\\nThis project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:\\n\\n### `Button.css`\\n\\n```css\\n.Button {\\n  padding: 20px;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### `Button.js`\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { Component } from \\'react\\';\\nimport \\'./Button.css\\'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles\\n\\nclass Button extends Component {\\n  render() {\\n    // You can use them as regular CSS styles\\n    return <div className=\"Button\" />;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.\\n\\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.\\n\\nIf you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\\n\\n## Post-Processing CSS\\n\\nThis project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.\\n\\nFor example, this:\\n\\n```css\\n.App {\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-direction: row;\\n  align-items: center;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nbecomes this:\\n\\n```css\\n.App {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;\\n  -webkit-box-direction: normal;\\n      -ms-flex-direction: row;\\n          flex-direction: row;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n      -ms-flex-align: center;\\n          align-items: center;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, [follow this section](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#disabling).\\n\\n## Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)\\n\\nGenerally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).\\n\\nFollowing this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.\\n\\nFirst, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save node-sass-chokidar\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add node-sass-chokidar\\n```\\n\\nThen in `package.json`, add the following lines to `scripts`:\\n\\n```diff\\n   \"scripts\": {\\n+    \"build-css\": \"node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/\",\\n+    \"watch-css\": \"npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive\",\\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n     \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\n     \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\\n```\\n\\n>Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace `build-css` and `watch-css` commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.\\n\\nNow you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and run `npm run watch-css`. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting `src/App.css`. Since `src/App.js` still imports `src/App.css`, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit `src/App.scss`, and `src/App.css` will be regenerated.\\n\\nTo share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import \"./shared.scss\";` with variable definitions.\\n\\nTo enable importing files without using relative paths, you can add the  `--include-path` option to the command in `package.json`.\\n\\n```\\n\"build-css\": \"node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/\",\\n\"watch-css\": \"npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive\",\\n```\\n\\nThis will allow you to do imports like\\n\\n```scss\\n@import \\'styles/_colors.scss\\'; // assuming a styles directory under src/\\n@import \\'nprogress/nprogress\\'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module\\n```\\n\\nAt this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add `src/**/*.css` to your `.gitignore` file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.\\n\\nAs a final step, you may find it convenient to run `watch-css` automatically with `npm start`, and run `build-css` as a part of `npm run build`. You can use the `&&` operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save npm-run-all\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add npm-run-all\\n```\\n\\nThen we can change `start` and `build` scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:\\n\\n```diff\\n   \"scripts\": {\\n     \"build-css\": \"node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/\",\\n     \"watch-css\": \"npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive\",\\n-    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n-    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\n+    \"start-js\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n+    \"start\": \"npm-run-all -p watch-css start-js\",\\n+    \"build\": \"npm run build-css && react-scripts build\",\\n     \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\\n     \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\\n   }\\n```\\n\\nNow running `npm start` and `npm run build` also builds Sass files.\\n\\n**Why `node-sass-chokidar`?**\\n\\n`node-sass` has been reported as having the following issues:\\n\\n- `node-sass --watch` has been reported to have *performance issues* in certain conditions when used in a virtual machine or with docker.\\n\\n- Infinite styles compiling [#1939](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1939)\\n\\n- `node-sass` has been reported as having issues with detecting new files in a directory [#1891](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1891)\\n\\n `node-sass-chokidar` is used here as it addresses these issues.\\n\\n## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files\\n\\nWith Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\\n\\nYou can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.\\n\\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1153).\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from \\'react\\';\\nimport logo from \\'./logo.png\\'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image\\n\\nconsole.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png\\n\\nfunction Header() {\\n  // Import result is the URL of your image\\n  return <img src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" />;\\n}\\n\\nexport default Header;\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\\n\\nThis works in CSS too:\\n\\n```css\\n.Logo {\\n  background-image: url(./logo.png);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\\n\\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.\\n\\n**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>\\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\\n\\n## Using the `public` Folder\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\\n\\n### Changing the HTML\\n\\nThe `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to [set the page title](#changing-the-page-title).\\nThe `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.\\n\\n### Adding Assets Outside of the Module System\\n\\nYou can also add other assets to the `public` folder.\\n\\nNote that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.\\nFor example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) and [adding images and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files).\\nThis mechanism provides a number of benefits:\\n\\n* Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.\\n* Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.\\n* Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.\\n\\nHowever there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.\\n\\nIf you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.\\n\\nInside `index.html`, you can use it like this:\\n\\n```html\\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\">\\n```\\n\\nOnly files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.\\n\\nWhen you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.\\n\\nIn JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:\\n\\n```js\\nrender() {\\n  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!\\n  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs\\n  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.\\n  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \\'/img/logo.png\\'} />;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nKeep in mind the downsides of this approach:\\n\\n* None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.\\n* Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.\\n* Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.\\n\\n### When to Use the `public` Folder\\n\\nNormally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript.\\nThe `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:\\n\\n* You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).\\n* You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.\\n* You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.\\n* Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.\\n\\nNote that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.\\n\\n## Using Global Variables\\n\\nWhen you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.\\n\\nYou can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:\\n\\n```js\\nconst $ = window.$;\\n```\\n\\nThis makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it.\\n\\n## Adding Bootstrap\\n\\nYou don’t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:\\n\\nInstall React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\\n```\\n\\nImport Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your ```src/index.js``` file:\\n\\n```js\\nimport \\'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\\';\\nimport \\'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css\\';\\n// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your\\n// components takes precedence over default styles.\\n```\\n\\nImport required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from \\'react-bootstrap\\';\\n```\\n\\nNow you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [`App.js`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap.\\n\\n### Using a Custom Theme\\n\\nSometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).<br>\\nWe suggest the following approach:\\n\\n* Create a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap.\\n* Add the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm.\\n* Install your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.\\n\\nHere is an example of adding a [customized Bootstrap](https://medium.com/@tacomanator/customizing-create-react-app-aa9ffb88165) that follows these steps.\\n\\n## Adding Flow\\n\\nFlow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.\\n\\nRecent versions of [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) work with Create React App projects out of the box.\\n\\nTo add Flow to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Run `npm install --save flow-bin` (or `yarn add flow-bin`).\\n2. Add `\"flow\": \"flow\"` to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.\\n3. Run `npm run flow init` (or `yarn flow init`) to create a [`.flowconfig` file](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html) in the root directory.\\n4. Add `// @flow` to any files you want to type check (for example, to `src/App.js`).\\n\\nNow you can run `npm run flow` (or `yarn flow`) to check the files for type errors.\\nYou can optionally use an IDE like [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/) for a better integrated experience.\\nIn the future we plan to integrate it into Create React App even more closely.\\n\\nTo learn more about Flow, check out [its documentation](https://flowtype.org/).\\n\\n## Adding Custom Environment Variables\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\\n\\nYour project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By\\ndefault you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with\\n`REACT_APP_`.\\n\\n**The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like [described here](#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.\\n\\n>Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\\n\\nThese environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment\\nvariable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`.\\n\\nThere is also a special built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `\\'development\\'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `\\'test\\'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `\\'production\\'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.\\n\\nThese environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is\\ndeployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.\\n\\nFirst, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined\\nin the environment inside a `<form>`:\\n\\n```jsx\\nrender() {\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>\\n      <form>\\n        <input type=\"hidden\" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />\\n      </form>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nDuring the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.\\n\\nWhen you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:\\n\\n```html\\n<div>\\n  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>\\n  <form>\\n    <input type=\"hidden\" value=\"abcdef\" />\\n  </form>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nThe above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this\\nvalue, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in\\na `.env` file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.\\n\\nHaving access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:\\n\\n```js\\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \\'production\\') {\\n  analytics.disable();\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen you compile the app with `npm run build`, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.\\n\\n### Referencing Environment Variables in the HTML\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\\n\\nYou can also access the environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_` in the `public/index.html`. For example:\\n\\n```html\\n<title>%REACT_APP_WEBSITE_NAME%</title>\\n```\\n\\nNote that the caveats from the above section apply:\\n\\n* Apart from a few built-in variables (`NODE_ENV` and `PUBLIC_URL`), variable names must start with `REACT_APP_` to work.\\n* The environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, [follow this approach instead](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server).\\n\\n### Adding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell\\n\\nDefining environment variables can vary between OSes. It’s also important to know that this manner is temporary for the\\nlife of the shell session.\\n\\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\\n\\n```cmd\\nset REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef&&npm start\\n```\\n\\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\\n\\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\\n\\n```bash\\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start\\n```\\n\\n### Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\\n\\nTo define permanent environment variables, create a file called `.env` in the root of your project:\\n\\n```\\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef\\n```\\n\\n`.env` files **should be** checked into source control (with the exclusion of `.env*.local`).\\n\\n#### What other `.env` files are can be used?\\n\\n>Note: this feature is **available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher**.\\n\\n* `.env`: Default.\\n* `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**\\n* `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.\\n* `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.\\n\\nFiles on the left have more priority than files on the right:\\n\\n* `npm start`: `.env.development.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`\\n* `npm run build`: `.env.production.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.local`, `.env`\\n* `npm test`: `.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env` (note `.env.local` is missing)\\n\\nThese variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.<br>\\nPlease refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.\\n\\n>Note: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need\\nthese defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).\\n\\n## Can I Use Decorators?\\n\\nMany popular libraries use [decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841) in their documentation.<br>\\nCreate React App doesn’t support decorator syntax at the moment because:\\n\\n* It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change.\\n* The current specification version is not officially supported by Babel.\\n* If the specification changes, we won’t be able to write a codemod because we don’t use them internally at Facebook.\\n\\nHowever in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators just as fine.<br>\\nPlease refer to these two threads for reference:\\n\\n* [#214](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/214)\\n* [#411](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/411)\\n\\nCreate React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.\\n\\n## Integrating with an API Backend\\n\\nThese tutorials will help you to integrate your app with an API backend running on another port,\\nusing `fetch()` to access it.\\n\\n### Node\\nCheck out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/).\\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo).\\n\\n### Ruby on Rails\\n\\nCheck out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/).\\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails).\\n\\n## Proxying API Requests in Development\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\\n\\nPeople often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.<br>\\nFor example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:\\n\\n```\\n/             - static server returns index.html with React app\\n/todos        - static server returns index.html with React app\\n/api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation\\n```\\n\\nSuch setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch(\\'/api/todos\\')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.\\n\\nTo tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:\\n\\n```js\\n  \"proxy\": \"http://localhost:4000\",\\n```\\n\\nThis way, when you `fetch(\\'/api/todos\\')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without a `text/html` accept header to the proxy.\\n\\nConveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:\\n\\n```\\nFetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No \\'Access-Control-Allow-Origin\\' header is present on the requested resource. Origin \\'http://localhost:3000\\' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request\\'s mode to \\'no-cors\\' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\\n```\\n\\nKeep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.\\n\\nThe `proxy` option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.<br>\\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:\\n\\n* [Configure the proxy yourself](#configuring-the-proxy-manually)\\n* Enable CORS on your server ([here’s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)).\\n* Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app.\\n\\n### \"Invalid Host Header\" Errors After Configuring Proxy\\n\\nWhen you enable the `proxy` option, you opt into a more strict set of host checks. This is necessary because leaving the backend open to remote hosts makes your computer vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The issue is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a) and [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887).\\n\\nThis shouldn’t affect you when developing on `localhost`, but if you develop remotely like [described here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2271), you will see this error in the browser after enabling the `proxy` option:\\n\\n>Invalid Host header\\n\\nTo work around it, you can specify your public development host in a file called `.env.development` in the root of your project:\\n\\n```\\nHOST=mypublicdevhost.com\\n```\\n\\nIf you restart the development server now and load the app from the specified host, it should work.\\n\\nIf you are still having issues or if you’re using a more exotic environment like a cloud editor, you can bypass the host check completely by adding a line to `.env.development.local`. **Note that this is dangerous and exposes your machine to remote code execution from malicious websites:**\\n\\n```\\n# NOTE: THIS IS DANGEROUS!\\n# It exposes your machine to attacks from the websites you visit.\\nDANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true\\n```\\n\\nWe don’t recommend this approach.\\n\\n### Configuring the Proxy Manually\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher.\\n\\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, you can specify an object in the following form (in `package.json`).<br>\\nYou may also specify any configuration value [`http-proxy-middleware`](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#options) or [`http-proxy`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options) supports.\\n```js\\n{\\n  // ...\\n  \"proxy\": {\\n    \"/api\": {\\n      \"target\": \"<url>\",\\n      \"ws\": true\\n      // ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n  // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll requests matching this path will be proxies, no exceptions. This includes requests for `text/html`, which the standard `proxy` option does not proxy.\\n\\nIf you need to specify multiple proxies, you may do so by specifying additional entries.\\nYou may also narrow down matches using `*` and/or `**`, to match the path exactly or any subpath.\\n```js\\n{\\n  // ...\\n  \"proxy\": {\\n    // Matches any request starting with /api\\n    \"/api\": {\\n      \"target\": \"<url_1>\",\\n      \"ws\": true\\n      // ...\\n    },\\n    // Matches any request starting with /foo\\n    \"/foo\": {\\n      \"target\": \"<url_2>\",\\n      \"ssl\": true,\\n      \"pathRewrite\": {\\n        \"^/foo\": \"/foo/beta\"\\n      }\\n      // ...\\n    },\\n    // Matches /bar/abc.html but not /bar/sub/def.html\\n    \"/bar/*.html\": {\\n      \"target\": \"<url_3>\",\\n      // ...\\n    },\\n    // Matches /baz/abc.html and /baz/sub/def.html\\n    \"/baz/**/*.html\": {\\n      \"target\": \"<url_4>\"\\n      // ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n  // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Configuring a WebSocket Proxy\\n\\nWhen setting up a WebSocket proxy, there are a some extra considerations to be aware of.\\n\\nIf you’re using a WebSocket engine like [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), you must have a Socket.io server running that you can use as the proxy target. Socket.io will not work with a standard WebSocket server. Specifically, don\\'t expect Socket.io to work with [the websocket.org echo test](http://websocket.org/echo.html).\\n\\nThere’s some good documentation available for [setting up a Socket.io server](https://socket.io/docs/).\\n\\nStandard WebSockets **will** work with a standard WebSocket server as well as the websocket.org echo test. You can use libraries like [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for the server, with [native WebSockets in the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).\\n\\nEither way, you can proxy WebSocket requests manually in `package.json`:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  // ...\\n  \"proxy\": {\\n    \"/socket\": {\\n      // Your compatible WebSocket server\\n      \"target\": \"ws://<socket_url>\",\\n      // Tell http-proxy-middleware that this is a WebSocket proxy.\\n      // Also allows you to proxy WebSocket requests without an additional HTTP request\\n      // https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#external-websocket-upgrade\\n      \"ws\": true\\n      // ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n  // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Using HTTPS in Development\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\\n\\nYou may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the \"proxy\" feature](#proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\\n\\nTo do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:\\n\\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\\n\\n```cmd\\nset HTTPS=true&&npm start\\n```\\n\\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\\n\\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\\n\\n```bash\\nHTTPS=true npm start\\n```\\n\\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\\n\\n## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server\\n\\nSince Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:\\n\\n```html\\n<!doctype html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\n  <head>\\n    <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"__OG_TITLE__\">\\n    <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"__OG_DESCRIPTION__\">\\n```\\n\\nThen, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `__OG_TITLE__`, `__OG_DESCRIPTION__`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!\\n\\nIf you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.\\n\\n## Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files\\n\\nIf you’re hosting your `build` with a static hosting provider you can use [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.\\n\\nThere are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.\\n\\nThe primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.\\n\\nYou can read more about [zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319).\\n\\n## Injecting Data from the Server into the Page\\n\\nSimilarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:\\n\\n```js\\n<!doctype html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\n  <head>\\n    <script>\\n      window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;\\n    </script>\\n```\\n\\nThen, on the server, you can replace `__SERVER_DATA__` with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read `window.SERVER_DATA` to use it. **Make sure to [sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client](https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0) as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.**\\n\\n## Running Tests\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br>\\n>[Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)\\n\\nCreate React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.\\n\\nJest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.\\n\\nWhile Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.\\n\\nWe recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.\\n\\n### Filename Conventions\\n\\nJest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:\\n\\n* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.\\n* Files with `.test.js` suffix.\\n* Files with `.spec.js` suffix.\\n\\nThe `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.\\n\\nWe recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from \\'./App\\'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.\\n\\n### Command Line Interface\\n\\nWhen you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.\\n\\nThe watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:\\n\\n![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif)\\n\\n### Version Control Integration\\n\\nBy default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.\\n\\nJest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.\\n\\nJest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.\\n\\n### Writing Tests\\n\\nTo create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.\\n\\nJest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport sum from \\'./sum\\';\\n\\nit(\\'sums numbers\\', () => {\\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);\\n  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nAll `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br>\\nYou can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create “spies” or mock functions.\\n\\n### Testing Components\\n\\nThere is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.\\n\\nDifferent projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from \\'react\\';\\nimport ReactDOM from \\'react-dom\\';\\nimport App from \\'./App\\';\\n\\nit(\\'renders without crashing\\', () => {\\n  const div = document.createElement(\\'div\\');\\n  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.\\n\\nWhen you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.\\n\\nIf you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). To install it, run:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save enzyme react-test-renderer\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add enzyme react-test-renderer\\n```\\n\\nYou can write a smoke test with it too:\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from \\'react\\';\\nimport { shallow } from \\'enzyme\\';\\nimport App from \\'./App\\';\\n\\nit(\\'renders without crashing\\', () => {\\n  shallow(<App />);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nUnlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.\\n\\nYou can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.\\n\\nHere is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from \\'react\\';\\nimport { shallow } from \\'enzyme\\';\\nimport App from \\'./App\\';\\n\\nit(\\'renders welcome message\\', () => {\\n  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);\\n  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;\\n  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);\\n  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nAll Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br>\\nNevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.\\n\\nAdditionally, you might find [jest-enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above `contains` code can be written simpler with jest-enzyme.\\n\\n```js\\nexpect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome)\\n```\\n\\nTo enable this, install `jest-enzyme`:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save jest-enzyme\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add jest-enzyme\\n```\\n\\nImport it in [`src/setupTests.js`](#initializing-test-environment) to make its matchers available in every test:\\n\\n```js\\nimport \\'jest-enzyme\\';\\n```\\n\\n### Using Third Party Assertion Libraries\\n\\nWe recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).\\n\\nHowever, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport sinon from \\'sinon\\';\\nimport { expect } from \\'chai\\';\\n```\\n\\nand then use them in your tests like you normally do.\\n\\n### Initializing Test Environment\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\\n\\nIf your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.js` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n#### `src/setupTests.js`\\n```js\\nconst localStorageMock = {\\n  getItem: jest.fn(),\\n  setItem: jest.fn(),\\n  clear: jest.fn()\\n};\\nglobal.localStorage = localStorageMock\\n```\\n\\n### Focusing and Excluding Tests\\n\\nYou can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.<br>\\nSimilarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.\\n\\n### Coverage Reporting\\n\\nJest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>\\nRun `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:\\n\\n![coverage report](http://i.imgur.com/5bFhnTS.png)\\n\\nNote that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.\\n\\n### Continuous Integration\\n\\nBy default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.\\n\\nWhen creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.\\n\\nPopular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:\\n\\n### On CI servers\\n#### Travis CI\\n\\n1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis.  You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.\\n1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.\\n```\\nlanguage: node_js\\nnode_js:\\n  - 6\\ncache:\\n  directories:\\n    - node_modules\\nscript:\\n  - npm test\\n  - npm run build\\n```\\n1. Trigger your first build with a git push.\\n1. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.\\n\\n#### CircleCI\\n\\nFollow [this article](https://medium.com/@knowbody/circleci-and-zeits-now-sh-c9b7eebcd3c1) to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.\\n\\n### On your own environment\\n##### Windows (cmd.exe)\\n\\n```cmd\\nset CI=true&&npm test\\n```\\n\\n```cmd\\nset CI=true&&npm run build\\n```\\n\\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\\n\\n##### Linux, macOS (Bash)\\n\\n```bash\\nCI=true npm test\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\nCI=true npm run build\\n```\\n\\nThe test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.\\n\\n>  If you find yourself doing this often in development, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new) to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.\\n\\nThe build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.\\n\\n### Disabling jsdom\\n\\nBy default, the `package.json` of the generated project looks like this:\\n\\n```js\\n  \"scripts\": {\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\"\\n```\\n\\nIf you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely remove `--env=jsdom`, and your tests will run faster:\\n\\n```diff\\n  \"scripts\": {\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\n-   \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\"\\n+   \"test\": \"react-scripts test\"\\n```\\n\\nTo help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:\\n\\n* Any browser globals like `window` and `document`\\n* [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)\\n* [`TestUtils.renderIntoDocument()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) ([a shortcut](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/34761cf9a252964abfaab6faf74d473ad95d1f21/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L83-L91) for the above)\\n* [`mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\\n\\nIn contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:\\n\\n* [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)\\n* [`shallow()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\\n\\nFinally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).\\n\\n### Snapshot Testing\\n\\nSnapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. [Read more about snapshot testing.](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)\\n\\n### Editor Integration\\n\\nIf you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.\\n\\n![VS Code Jest Preview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/20795349/a032308a-b7c8-11e6-9b34-7eeac781003f.png)\\n\\n## Developing Components in Isolation\\n\\nUsually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.\\nFor an example, a simple button component could have following states:\\n\\n* In a regular state, with a text label.\\n* In the disabled mode.\\n* In a loading state.\\n\\nUsually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.\\n\\nCreate React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add [Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org) ([source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)) or [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)) to your project. **These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.\\n\\n![Storybook for React Demo](http://i.imgur.com/7CIAWpB.gif)\\n\\nYou can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.\\n\\n### Getting Started with Storybook\\n\\nStorybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\\n\\nFirst, install the following npm package globally:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install -g @storybook/cli\\n```\\n\\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\\n\\n```sh\\ngetstorybook\\n```\\n\\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\\n\\nLearn more about React Storybook:\\n\\n* Screencast: [Getting Started with React Storybook](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-getting-started-with-react-storybook)\\n* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)\\n* [Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/introduction/)\\n* [Snapshot Testing UI](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots) with Storybook + addon/storyshot\\n\\n### Getting Started with Styleguidist\\n\\nStyleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.\\n\\nFirst, install Styleguidist:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save react-styleguidist\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add react-styleguidist\\n```\\n\\nThen, add these scripts to your `package.json`:\\n\\n```diff\\n   \"scripts\": {\\n+    \"styleguide\": \"styleguidist server\",\\n+    \"styleguide:build\": \"styleguidist build\",\\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n```\\n\\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm run styleguide\\n```\\n\\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\\n\\nLearn more about React Styleguidist:\\n\\n* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)\\n* [Documentation](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/getting-started.html)\\n\\n## Making a Progressive Web App\\n\\nBy default, the production build is a fully functional, offline-first\\n[Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).\\n\\nProgressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:\\n\\n * All static site assets are cached so that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.\\n * Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the Subway.\\n * On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user\\'s home screen, app icon and all. You can also re-engage users using web **push notifications**. This eliminates the need for the app store.\\n\\nThe [`sw-precache-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin)\\nis integrated into production configuration,\\nand it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically\\nprecache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.\\nThe service worker will use a [cache-first strategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)\\nfor handling all requests for local assets, including the initial HTML, ensuring\\nthat your web app is reliably fast, even on a slow or unreliable network.\\n\\nIf you would prefer not to enable service workers prior to your initial\\nproduction deployment, then remove the call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()`\\nfrom [`src/index.js`](src/index.js).\\n\\nIf you had previously enabled service workers in your production deployment and\\nhave decided that you would like to disable them for all your existing users,\\nyou can swap out the call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()` in\\n[`src/index.js`](src/index.js) with a call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()`.\\nAfter the user visits a page that has `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()`,\\nthe service worker will be uninstalled.\\n\\n### Offline-First Considerations\\n\\n1. Service workers [require HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https),\\nalthough to facilitate local testing, that policy\\n[does not apply to `localhost`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385).\\nIf your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker\\nregistration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.\\n\\n1. Service workers are [not currently supported](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)\\nin all web browsers. Service worker registration [won\\'t be attempted](src/registerServiceWorker.js)\\non browsers that lack support.\\n\\n1. The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](#deployment),\\ne.g. the output of `npm run build`. It\\'s recommended that you do not enable an\\noffline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to\\nfrustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest\\nchanges you\\'ve made locally.\\n\\n1. If you *need* to test your offline-first service worker locally, build\\nthe application (using `npm run build`) and run a simple http server from your\\nbuild directory. After running the build script, `create-react-app` will give\\ninstructions for one way to test your production build locally and the [deployment instructions](#deployment) have\\ninstructions for using other methods. *Be sure to always use an\\nincognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache.*\\n\\n1. If possible, configure your production environment to serve the generated\\n`service-worker.js` [with HTTP caching disabled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38843970/service-worker-javascript-update-frequency-every-24-hours).\\nIf that\\'s not possible—[GitHub Pages](#github-pages), for instance, does not\\nallow you to change the default 10 minute HTTP cache lifetime—then be aware\\nthat if you visit your production site, and then revisit again before\\n`service-worker.js` has expired from your HTTP cache, you\\'ll continue to get\\nthe previously cached assets from the service worker. If you have an immediate\\nneed to view your updated production deployment, performing a shift-refresh\\nwill temporarily disable the service worker and retrieve all assets from the\\nnetwork.\\n\\n1. Users aren\\'t always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to\\n[let the user know](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption)\\nwhen the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a \"This web\\napp works offline!\" message) and also let them know when the service worker has\\nfetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the\\npage (showing a \"New content is available; please refresh.\" message). Showing\\nthis messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a\\nstarting point, you can make use of the logic included in [`src/registerServiceWorker.js`](src/registerServiceWorker.js), which\\ndemonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each\\nscenario, and which as a default, just logs appropriate messages to the\\nJavaScript console.\\n\\n1. By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any\\ncross-origin traffic, like HTTP [API requests](#integrating-with-an-api-backend),\\nimages, or embeds loaded from a different domain. If you would like to use a\\nruntime caching strategy for those requests, you can [`eject`](#npm-run-eject)\\nand then configure the\\n[`runtimeCaching`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#runtimecaching-arrayobject)\\noption in the `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` section of\\n[`webpack.config.prod.js`](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).\\n\\n### Progressive Web App Metadata\\n\\nThe default configuration includes a web app manifest located at\\n[`public/manifest.json`](public/manifest.json), that you can customize with\\ndetails specific to your web application.\\n\\nWhen a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on\\nAndroid, the metadata in [`manifest.json`](public/manifest.json) determines what\\nicons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.\\n[The Web App Manifest guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/)\\nprovides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations\\nwill affect your users\\' experience.\\n\\n## Analyzing the Bundle Size\\n\\n[Source map explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) analyzes\\nJavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code\\nbloat is coming from.\\n\\nTo add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save source-map-explorer\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\n\\n```sh\\nyarn add source-map-explorer\\n```\\n\\nThen in `package.json`, add the following line to `scripts`:\\n\\n```diff\\n   \"scripts\": {\\n+    \"analyze\": \"source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.*\",\\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\n     \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\n     \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\\n```\\n\\n>**Note:**\\n>\\n>This doesn\\'t quite work on Windows because it doesn\\'t automatically expand `*` in the filepath. For now, the workaround is to look at the full hashed filename in `build/static/js` (e.g. `main.89b7e95a.js`) and copy it into `package.json` when you\\'re running the analyzer. For example:\\n>\\n>```diff\\n>+    \"analyze\": \"source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.89b7e95a.js\",\\n>```\\n>\\n>Unfortunately it will be different after every build. You can express support for fixing this on Windows [in this issue](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer/issues/52).\\n\\nThen to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze\\nscript.\\n\\n```\\nnpm run build\\nnpm run analyze\\n```\\n\\n## Deployment\\n\\n`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.\\n\\n### Static Server\\n\\nFor environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install -g serve\\nserve -s build\\n```\\n\\nThe last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.\\n\\nRun this command to get a full list of the options available:\\n\\n```sh\\nserve -h\\n```\\n\\n### Other Solutions\\n\\nYou don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.\\n\\nHere’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/):\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require(\\'express\\');\\nconst path = require(\\'path\\');\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \\'build\\')));\\n\\napp.get(\\'/\\', function (req, res) {\\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \\'build\\', \\'index.html\\'));\\n});\\n\\napp.listen(9000);\\n```\\n\\nThe choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.\\n\\nThe `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.\\n\\nHowever this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.\\n\\n### Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing\\n\\nIf you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.\\n\\nThis is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:\\n\\n```diff\\n app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \\'build\\')));\\n\\n-app.get(\\'/\\', function (req, res) {\\n+app.get(\\'/*\\', function (req, res) {\\n   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \\'build\\', \\'index.html\\'));\\n });\\n```\\n\\nIf you’re using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), you need to create a `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder that looks like this:\\n\\n```\\n    Options -MultiViews\\n    RewriteEngine On\\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\\n    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]\\n```\\n\\nIt will get copied to the `build` folder when you run `npm run build`. \\n\\nIf you’re using [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), you need to follow [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41249464/4878474).\\n\\nNow requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production.\\n\\nOn a production build, and in a browser that supports [service workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers),\\nthe service worker will automatically handle all navigation requests, like for\\n`/todos/42`, by serving the cached copy of your `index.html`. This\\nservice worker navigation routing can be configured or disabled by\\n[`eject`ing](#npm-run-eject) and then modifying the\\n[`navigateFallback`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallback-string)\\nand [`navigateFallbackWhitelist`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallbackwhitelist-arrayregexp)\\noptions of the `SWPreachePlugin` [configuration](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).\\n\\n### Building for Relative Paths\\n\\nBy default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.<br>\\nTo override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:\\n\\n```js\\n  \"homepage\": \"http://mywebsite.com/relativepath\",\\n```\\n\\nThis will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.\\n\\n#### Serving the Same Build from Different Paths\\n\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\\n\\nIf you are not using the HTML5 `pushState` history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your `package.json`:\\n\\n```js\\n  \"homepage\": \".\",\\n```\\n\\nThis will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to `index.html`. You will then be able to move your app from `http://mywebsite.com` to `http://mywebsite.com/relativepath` or even `http://mywebsite.com/relative/path` without having to rebuild it.\\n\\n### Azure\\n\\nSee [this](https://medium.com/@to_pe/deploying-create-react-app-on-microsoft-azure-c0f6686a4321) blog post on how to deploy your React app to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).\\n\\n### Firebase\\n\\nInstall the Firebase CLI if you haven’t already by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`. Sign up for a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Run `firebase login` and login with your previous created Firebase account.\\n\\nThen run the `firebase init` command from your project’s root. You need to choose the **Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites** and choose the Firebase project you created in the previous step.

This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\\n\\n* You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Router) about different history implementations in React Router.\\n* Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).\\n\\n### Heroku\\n\\nUse the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).<br>\\nYou can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).\\n\\n#### Resolving Heroku Deployment Errors\\n\\nSometimes `npm run build` works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.\\n\\n##### \"Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \\'file\\' or \\'directory\\'\"\\n\\nIf you get something like this:\\n\\n```\\nremote: Failed to create a production build. Reason:\\nremote: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \\'file\\' or \\'directory\\'\\nMyDirectory in /tmp/build_1234/src\\n```\\n\\nIt means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you `import` matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.\\n\\nThis is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So `MyDirectory` and `mydirectory` are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the `import` statements on Heroku remotes.\\n\\n##### \"Could not find a required file.\"\\n\\nIf you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:\\n\\n```\\nremote: Could not find a required file.\\nremote:   Name: `index.html`\\nremote:   Searched in: /tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/public\\nremote:\\nremote: npm ERR! Linux 3.13.0-105-generic\\nremote: npm ERR! argv \"/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/node\" \"/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/npm\" \"run\" \"build\"\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, ensure that the file is there with the proper lettercase and that’s not ignored on your local `.gitignore` or `~/.gitignore_global`.\\n\\n### Modulus\\n\\nSee the [Modulus blog post](http://blog.modulus.io/deploying-react-apps-on-modulus) on how to deploy your react app to Modulus.\\n\\n### Netlify\\n\\n**To do a manual deploy to Netlify’s CDN:**\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install netlify-cli\\nnetlify deploy\\n```\\n\\nChoose `build` as the path to deploy.\\n\\n**To setup continuous delivery:**\\n\\nWith this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:\\n\\n1. [Start a new netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup)\\n2. Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository\\n3. Click `Build your site`\\n\\n**Support for client-side routing:**\\n\\nTo support `pushState`, make sure to create a `public/_redirects` file with the following rewrite rules:\\n\\n```\\n/*  /index.html  200\\n```\\n\\nWhen you build the project, Create React App will place the `public` folder contents into the build output.\\n\\n### Now\\n\\n[now](https://zeit.co/now) offers a zero-configuration single-command deployment. You can use `now` to deploy your app for free.\\n\\n1. Install the `now` command-line tool either via the recommended [desktop tool](https://zeit.co/download) or via node with `npm install -g now`.\\n\\n2. Build your app by running `npm run build`.\\n\\n3. Move into the build directory by running `cd build`.\\n\\n4. Run `now --name your-project-name` from within the build directory. You will see a **now.sh** URL in your output like this:\\n\\n    ```\\n    > Ready! https://your-project-name-tpspyhtdtk.now.sh (copied to clipboard)\\n    ```\\n\\n    Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app.\\n\\nDetails are available in [this article.](https://zeit.co/blog/unlimited-static)\\n\\n### S3 and CloudFront\\n\\nSee this [blog post](https://medium.com/@omgwtfmarc/deploying-create-react-app-to-s3-or-cloudfront-48dae4ce0af) on how to deploy your React app to Amazon Web Services [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).\\n\\n### Surge\\n\\nInstall the Surge CLI if you haven’t already by running `npm install -g surge`. Run the `surge` command and log in you or create a new account.\\n\\nWhen asked about the project path, make sure to specify the `build` folder, for example:\\n\\n```sh\\n       project path: /path/to/project/build\\n```\\n\\nNote that in order to support routers that use HTML5 `pushState` API, you may want to rename the `index.html` in your build folder to `200.html` before deploying to Surge. This [ensures that every URL falls back to that file](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing).\\n\\n## Advanced Configuration\\n\\nYou can adjust various development and production settings by setting environment variables in your shell or with [.env](#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env).\\n\\nVariable | Development | Production | Usage\\n:--- | :---: | :---: | :---\\nBROWSER | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a [browser](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn#app) to override this behavior, or set it to `none` to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to `npm start` will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script\\'s file name must have the `.js` extension.\\nHOST | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, the development web server binds to `localhost`. You may use this variable to specify a different host.\\nPORT | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, the development web server will attempt to listen on port 3000 or prompt you to attempt the next available port. You may use this variable to specify a different port.\\nHTTPS | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When set to `true`, Create React App will run the development server in `https` mode.\\nPUBLIC_URL | :x: | :white_check_mark: | Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server\\'s root or a subpath as specified in [`package.json` (`homepage`)](#building-for-relative-paths). Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.\\nCI | :large_orange_diamond: | :white_check_mark: | When set to `true`, Create React App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching. Most CIs set this flag by default.\\nREACT_EDITOR | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace. When you click on it, Create React App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file. You can [send a pull request to detect your editor of choice](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2636). Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection. If you do it, make sure your systems [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable points to your editor’s bin folder.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\n### `npm start` doesn’t detect changes\\n\\nWhen you save a file while `npm start` is running, the browser should refresh with the updated code.<br>\\nIf this doesn’t happen, try one of the following workarounds:\\n\\n* If your project is in a Dropbox folder, try moving it out.\\n* If the watcher doesn’t see a file called `index.js` and you’re referencing it by the folder name, you [need to restart the watcher](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1164) due to a Webpack bug.\\n* Some editors like Vim and IntelliJ have a “safe write” feature that currently breaks the watcher. You will need to disable it. Follow the instructions in [“Adjusting Your Text Editor”](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor).\\n* If your project path contains parentheses, try moving the project to a path without them. This is caused by a [Webpack watcher bug](https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/issues/42).\\n* On Linux and macOS, you might need to [tweak system settings](https://webpack.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#not-enough-watchers) to allow more watchers.\\n* If the project runs inside a virtual machine such as (a Vagrant provisioned) VirtualBox, create an `.env` file in your project directory if it doesn’t exist, and add `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` to it. This ensures that the next time you run `npm start`, the watcher uses the polling mode, as necessary inside a VM.\\n\\nIf none of these solutions help please leave a comment [in this thread](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/659).\\n\\n### `npm test` hangs on macOS Sierra\\n\\nIf you run `npm test` and the console gets stuck after printing `react-scripts test --env=jsdom` to the console there might be a problem with your [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) installation as described in [facebookincubator/create-react-app#713](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/713).\\n\\nWe recommend deleting `node_modules` in your project and running `npm install` (or `yarn` if you use it) first. If it doesn\\'t help, you can try one of the numerous workarounds mentioned in these issues:\\n\\n* [facebook/jest#1767](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767)\\n* [facebook/watchman#358](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/358)\\n* [ember-cli/ember-cli#6259](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6259)\\n\\nIt is reported that installing Watchman 4.7.0 or newer fixes the issue. If you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can run these commands to update it:\\n\\n```\\nwatchman shutdown-server\\nbrew update\\nbrew reinstall watchman\\n```\\n\\nYou can find [other installation methods](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install) on the Watchman documentation page.\\n\\nIf this still doesn’t help, try running `launchctl unload -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist`.\\n\\nThere are also reports that *uninstalling* Watchman fixes the issue. So if nothing else helps, remove it from your system and try again.\\n\\n### `npm run build` exits too early\\n\\nIt is reported that `npm run build` can fail on machines with limited memory and no swap space, which is common in cloud environments. Even with small projects this command can increase RAM usage in your system by hundreds of megabytes, so if you have less than 1 GB of available memory your build is likely to fail with the following message:\\n\\n>  The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.\\n\\nIf you are completely sure that you didn\\'t terminate the process, consider [adding some swap space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04) to the machine you’re building on, or build the project locally.\\n\\n### `npm run build` fails on Heroku\\n\\nThis may be a problem with case sensitive filenames.\\nPlease refer to [this section](#resolving-heroku-deployment-errors).\\n\\n### Moment.js locales are missing\\n\\nIf you use a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), you might notice that only the English locale is available by default. This is because the locale files are large, and you probably only need a subset of [all the locales provided by Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/#multiple-locale-support).\\n\\nTo add a specific Moment.js locale to your bundle, you need to import it explicitly.<br>\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nimport moment from \\'moment\\';\\nimport \\'moment/locale/fr\\';\\n```\\n\\nIf import multiple locales this way, you can later switch between them by calling `moment.locale()` with the locale name:\\n\\n```js\\nimport moment from \\'moment\\';\\nimport \\'moment/locale/fr\\';\\nimport \\'moment/locale/es\\';\\n\\n// ...\\n\\nmoment.locale(\\'fr\\');\\n```\\n\\nThis will only work for locales that have been explicitly imported before.\\n\\n## Something Missing?\\n\\nIf you have ideas for more “How To” recipes that should be on this page, [let us know](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues) or [contribute some!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/edit/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)\\n'},\n",

It also includess __support for media keys__. It is intended for use on Ubuntu systems - current dependency is notify-osd.\\n\\n![Example image](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100344/spotifynotify2.png)\\n\\n\\nGetting started\\n---------------\\n### Installation\\n\\nIf you want to install spotify-notify permanently, it\\'s recommended to follow these instructions. They apply to Ubuntu only but may work on other Debian-based distros as well.\\n\\nJust execute the following terminal commands to install spotify-notify:\\n```bash\\nsudo mkdir /opt/spotify-notify/     # Create new directory to install spotify-notify\\ncd /opt/spotify-notify/             # Change current directory to this folder\\n# Download current version of spotify-notify\\nsudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sveint/spotify-notify/master/spotify-notify.py\\nsudo chmod a+x spotify-notify.py    # Mark spotify-notify.py as an executable\\npython spotify-notify.py -s &       # Start spotify-notify in background\\n```\\n\\n### Adding spotify-notify to autostart\\nIn Ubuntu you can easily add spotify-notify to the autostart. You only need to open the startup-programmes dialog. More details can be found in the [Ubuntu Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup#Startup_Programs). As the name you can choose something like \"Spotify Notify\" and as the command to be executed, choose\\n\\n`python spotify-notify.py -s`\\n\\nThe comment field can be left empty.\\n\\nAdvanced\\n--------\\n### Running spotify-notify (general information)\\nTo get it running, you first need to clone this repository or download the file `spotify-notify.py`. Afterwards you can run spotify-notify by\\n\\n`python spotify-notify.py`\\n\\nIt will launch Spotify for you if not already running. Please see options below to change default behavior.\\n\\nIf you want to launch the file directly you can first add execution rights to it:\\n\\n`chmod a+x spotify-notify.py`\\n\\nthen launch by\\n\\n`./spotify-notify.py`\\n\\n### Command line options\\n\\nAvailable options are:\\n\\n| Option                        | Description                                                |\\n| ------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------:|\\n| `-h, --help`                  | Show help message and exit                                 |\\n| `-a ACTION, --action=ACTION`  | Music player actions (playPause/play/pause/next/previous). |\\n| `-n, --skip_notify`           | Song change notifications will be turned off.              |\\n| `-m, --skip_media_keys`       | Multimedia keys will not interact with spotify.            |\\n| `-s, --skip_spotify`          | Spotify will not be opened if it is not running and spotify notify will not close when spotify is closed. |\\n| `-d, --debug`                 | Debug messages will be displayed.                          |\\n\\n\\n\\n### FAQ\\n\\n\\n#### Q: How can I launch the script at startup?\\n\\nJust add a new entry to the startup applications, using the following as the \"Command\"-string;\\n\\n`/<path>/<to>/spotify-notify/spotify-notify.py -s`\\n\\n- Make sure that \"spotify-notify.py\" is executable\\n- Make note of the \"-s\" parameter at the end, as this makes sure that spotify-notify doesn\\'t start Spotify, and that it doesn\\'t quit when you quit Spotify.\\n\\n\\n#### Q: I want to use the script just for the media key support. How can I do this?\\n\\nLaunch with -n as parameter.\\n\\n\\n#### Q: Do I need Ubuntu to use this script? Will others distros work?\\n\\nA: Other distros supporting the same messaging system might work, please report any success stories!\\n\\n\\nSpotify-notify is in no way affiliated with Spotify.

       "  'readme_contents': '# Spotify Search\\n\\n**Objective:** Make a music search app using jQuery, AJAX, and the Spotify API. You\\'ll be using Spotify\\'s search endpoint to search for tracks (songs).\\n\\n## Minimum Requirements\\n\\n1. Your app must have a form to search for tracks (songs). The form needs an input field for the search keyword.\\n2. When a user submits the form, use jQuery to get the search keyword from the form input.\\n3. Use AJAX to call Spotify\\'s search endpoint with the search keyword from the form.\\n4. On success of the AJAX call, render the search results on the page. You should include at least the track name and artist name.\\n5. Each time the user submits the form, clear the previous search results from the view.\\n\\n## Bonus\\n\\n1. Display a track\\'s album artwork next to each search result in the view. **Hint:** You\\'ll notice if you try to access the album artwork but none is available, your app will break. Prevent this from happening with a check to see if any artwork is available first.\\n2. Spotify gives us a `preview_url` for each track. Create a play button for each track in your view that opens the `preview_url` in a new tab (it will start playing the song!).\\n3. It would be nice to let the user know something is happening in the few milliseconds between submitting the form and getting data on the page. Show `loading.gif` when the form submits, and hide it when you get data back from Spotify.\\n4. Handle the case where no data comes back from Spotify. You\\'ll want to let the user know that there are no results, rather than just showing a blank page.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.\\n2. Practice querying Spotify\\'s search endpoint using Postman with a couple different search keywords. You\\'ll want to set `type=track` in your request URL. Look at the response data, and figure out how you would access the track name and artist name for a particular track (this will involve accessing values from nested objects and arrays).\\n3. Once you feel comfortable with the structure of the response data, work on using AJAX to make the API call to Spotify when the user submits the form.\\n4. Start by `console.log`-ing the response data. Once you have that working, access the data you need (track name and artist name), and use jQuery to `append` it to the page. **Hint:** You\\'ll need to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\" target=\"_blank\">Array#forEach</a> to iterate through all the tracks Spotify returns in the response data.\\n\\n## Submission\\n\\n* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.\\n* Once you\\'ve finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n* <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery.get()</a>\\n* <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Search Endpoint</a>'},\n",

This only needs to be done once (per user).*</sup>\\n\\n## Required packages\\n\\nTo use SpotifyRandomizer, you need [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy).\\nYou can install it using `pip`: `pip3 install spotipy`\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n1. Create a spotify application so you can use `spotipy`. You can do this at the [Spotify developer website](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/).\\n2. Now you need to give the program your client ID & client secret. You can do this in 2 ways:\\n    1. Uncomment the lines in `randomizer.py` _(by removing the # in the beginning of the line)_ that set these variables and inputting yours.\\n       ```python\\n       os.environ[\"SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID\"] = \"myclientid\"\\n       os.environ[\"SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET\"] = \"myclientsecret\"\\n       ```\\n    2. Export those variables using your terminal. On windows:\\n    \\n       ```cmd\\n       SET SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=myclientid\\n       SET SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=myclientsecret\\n       ```\\n    \\n        On linux:\\n        ```bash\\n        export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=myclientid\\n        export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=myclientsecret\\n        ```\\n        \\n        You only need to do this once.\\n    \\n    The default redirect URL is `http://localhost:14523` for the local webserver.\\n3. Optionally, you can give the program the Spotify username and the playlists to shuffle. You can do this in 2 ways:\\n    1. Uncomment the lines in `randomizer.py` _(by removing the # in the beginning of the line)_ that set these variables and inputting yours.\\n       ```python\\n       os.environ[\"USER\"] = \"myusername\"\\n       os.environ[\"PLAYLISTS\"] = \"Playlist1,Playlist2,Playlist3\"\\n       ```\\n    2. Export those variables using your terminal. On windows:\\n\\n       ```cmd\\n       SET USER=myusername\\n       SET PLAYLISTS=Playlist1,Playlist2,Playlist3\\n       ```\\n\\n        On linux:\\n        ```bash\\n        export USER=myusername\\n        export PLAYLISTS=Playlist1,Playlist2,Playlist3\\n        ```\\n\\n        You only need to do this once.\\n4. You\\'re done - you can basically change anything else you\\'d like.\\n\\n## Run\\n\\nThe script can be ran by doing `python3 main.py`.\\nIn this case the program will ask you for your username and playlist(s) while running.\\nYou can also give that information as an argument, like this `python3 main.py 1234567890 Playlist1 Playlist2 Playlist3`\\n\\nThe playlists can be the name of the playlist or the ID of the playlist (found in the URL). These playlists have to be owned by you.\\n\\nWhen you run the program for the first time, it will open the spotify website for authorization. Then you need to copy the redirected URL into the commandline. After this, the program should work.\\n\\n### Other\\n\\nAlso check out [the repo SpotifyNoDupes](https://github.com/stavlocker/spotifynodupes) if you want to get rid of your duplicate songs in playlists.\\n'},\n",

Layouts for apps are different to websites so this will put your CSS Grid skills to the test!\\n\\n## Instructions\\nIn the `screens` folder you will see images of spotify at different resolutions. Your goal is replicate this layout structure as closely as possible. The image assets needed to complete the exercise are in the `assets/img` folder.\\n\\nFor the player icons, you can use your own images or Font Awesome icons (https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/).\\n\\n## Assesment Criteria\\n* &#9745; The overall structure of the layout reflects the `spotify-lg.png` reference image. \\n* &#9745; Fonts, colors and spacings used are similar (they don't need to be identical) to the reference images\\n* &#9745; CSS avoids repetition.\\n* &#9745; CSS class names are descriptive.\\n* &#9745; HTML is semantic and well structured.\\n\\n### Extension Criteria\\n* &#9745; The left menu collapses as shown in `spotify-xs.png`.\\n* &#9745; The list of albums expands and collapses to fill the available page space (see `spotify-md.png` and `spotify-s.png`)\\n* &#9745; The top navigation list wraps as the page size is reduced.\\n* &#9745; On hovering over cover images, a play icon appears overlaid.\\n* &#9745; Only the main content area scrolls - it moves behind the upgrade bar and the player controls.

       "  'readme_contents': '# Polybar Spotify Module\\n\\n![polybar-spotify-module](https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-spotify-module/raw/master/screenshots/capture2.png)\\n\\nThis is a pure C implementation of an external polybar module that signals\\npolybar when a track is playing/paused and when the track changes. There is\\nalso a program that retreives the title and artist of the currently playing\\nsong on spotify.\\n\\n\\n## Requirements\\nDBus is used for listening to spotify track changes. Obviously you need spotify\\nand polybar as well:\\n`dbus polybar spotify`\\n\\nTo compile the program, you will need `make`.\\n\\nYou most likely already have the above packages installed. Systemd depends on\\nDBus, and you wouldn\\'t be looking at this, if you didn\\'t have polybar and\\nspotify installed.\\n\\n\\n## How to Setup\\n\\n### Installing the Program\\nRun the following code to clone the repo and install the programs.\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-spotify-module\\ncd polybar-spotify-module/src/\\nsudo make install\\n```\\n\\n#### Arch Linux Users\\n`polybar-spotify-module` exists as a package on the AUR! Use your favourite\\nAUR helper to install the package.\\n```\\nyay -S polybar-spotify-module\\n```\\nThe package can be found here\\n<https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/polybar-spotify-module/>.\\n\\n### Running spotify-listener in the Background\\n`spotify-listener` must run in the background for it to be able to listen for\\ntrack changes and communicate with polybar. There are two ways to keep it\\nrunning in the background. If you are using systemd, you can have it start at\\nsystem startup by running:\\n\\n```\\nsystemctl --user enable spotify-listener\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can start the service now by running:\\n\\n```\\nsystemctl --user start spotify-listener\\n```\\n\\nIf you are not using systemd, make sure the `spotify-listener` program is\\nexecuted at startup. Something like\\n```\\nspotify-listener &\\ndisown\\n```\\nin a startup script should accomplish that.\\n\\n\\n### Configuring Polybar\\nYour polybar configuration file should be located at `.config/polybar/config`\\n\\nFirst make sure IPC is enabled. The following should be in your configuration\\nfile under the `[bar/<your bar name>]` section:\\n```\\n[bar/main]\\nenable-ipc = true\\n```\\n\\nIf you plan to use icons for next/play/previous/pause buttons, make sure you\\nadd (and have installed) an icon font accordingly such as NerdFonts or\\nFontAwesome under the `[bar/<your bar name>]` section:\\n```\\n[bar/main]\\nfont-1 = Font Awesome 5 Free:size=10;1\\n```\\nNote that the font is specified in modules as a 1-based index, so `font-1` is\\nspecified by `format-font = 2`.\\n\\nNext, add the following spotify modules:\\n```\\n[module/previous]\\ntype = custom/ipc\\nformat-font = 2\\n; Default\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\n; When spotify active\\nhook-1 = echo \"Previous\"\\nclick-left = \"spotifyctl -q previous\"\\n\\n\\n[module/next]\\ntype = custom/ipc\\nformat-font = 2\\n; Default\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\n; When spotify active\\nhook-1 = echo \"Next\"\\nclick-left = \"spotifyctl -q next\"\\n\\n\\n[module/playpause]\\ntype = custom/ipc\\nformat-font = 2\\n; Default\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\n; Playing\\nhook-1 = echo \"Pause\"\\n; Paused\\nhook-2 = echo \"Play\"\\nclick-left = \"spotifyctl -q playpause\"\\n\\n\\n[module/spotify]\\ntype = custom/ipc\\n; Default\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\n; Playing/paused show song name and artist\\nhook-1 = spotifyctl -q status --format \\'%artist%: %title%\\'\\n```\\nYou can replace the text for Pause/Play/Next/Previous with icons for each of\\nthe hooks.\\n\\nLastly, make sure the new spotify modules are part of your bar. Make sure one of\\nthe following lines is part of your modules.\\n```\\nmodules-center = spotify previous playpause next\\nmodules-left = spotify previous playpause next\\nmodules-right = spotify previous playpause next\\n```\\n\\n## Status Formatting\\nThe `spotifyctl status` command has multiple formatting options. You can\\nspecify the:\\n- Maximum output length\\n- Maximum artist length\\n- Maxiumum track title length\\n- Output Format\\n- Truncation string\\n\\nBy default, the above lengths are `INT_MAX` (no limit). Additionally, if max\\nlength is specified, the artist and track title will not be truncated if\\nthe untruncated output satisfies the output max length constraint.\\n\\nThe tokens `%artist%` and `%title%` can be used to specify the output format.\\n\\nFor example for the artist `Eminem` and track title `Sing For The Moment`\\n```\\nspotifyctl status --format \\'%artist%: %title%\\' --max-length 20 \\\\\\n    --max-title-length 10 --max-artist-length 10 --trunc \\'...\\'\\n```\\nwould result in the following output\\n```\\nEminem: Sing Fo...\\n```\\n\\nFor more information and examples, you can run the command `spotifyctl help`.\\n\\n\\n## How it Works\\nThe spotify-listener program connects to the DBus Session Bus and listens for\\ntwo particular signals:\\n\\n- `org.freedesktop.DBus.ProprtyChanged` for track changes\\n- `org.freedesktop.DBus.NameOwnerChanged` for spotify disconnections\\n\\nUsing this information, it sends messages to spotify polybar custom/IPC modules\\nto show/hide spotify controls and display the play/pause icon based on whether\\na song is playing/paused.\\n\\nThe spotifyctl program calls `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Properties.Get` method to\\nretreive status information and calls methods in the\\n`org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player` interface to pause/play and go to the\\nprevious/next track.\\n\\n\\n## Why Did I Make this in C\\n- Practice/learn low-level C\\n- Reduce number of dependencies\\n- Make something as lightweight as possible by directly interfacing with DBus\\n- For fun 😜\\n\\n\\n## Resources\\nThe following are very useful resources for DBus API and specs:\\n\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusConnection.html>\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusBus.html>\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusMessage.html>\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html>\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html>\\n\\n\\n## Credits\\nInspired by the python implementation by\\n[dietervanhoof](https://github.com/dietervanhoof): <https://github.com/dietervanhoof/polybar-spotify-controls>\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': \"backbone-spotify\\n================\\n\\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thisismyjam/backbone-spotify.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thisismyjam/backbone-spotify)\\n\\nA library for writing [Spotify apps](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/) with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org).\\n\\nIt currently includes ``BackboneSpotify.Router`` and ``BackboneSpotify.History``, replacements for Backbone's ``Router`` and ``History``.\\n\\nThe quickest way to get started is to take a look at the app inside the ``example/`` directory.\\n\\n``BackboneSpotify.Router``\\n--------------------------\\n\\nSpotify uses ``:`` instead of ``/`` to separate directories in URIs. ``BackboneSpotify.Router`` changes the syntax for parameters from ``:param`` to ``<param>`` so colons can be used as path separators. Otherwise, it works exactly the same as [Backbone's router](http://backbonejs.org/#Router).\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    var Router = BackboneSpotify.Router.extend({\\n        routes: {\\n            'index': 'index',\\n            'person:<name>': 'profile',\\n        },\\n\\n        index: function() {\\n            // ...\\n        },\\n\\n        profile: function(name) {\\n            // ...\\n        }\\n    });\\n\\n\\n``BackboneSpotify.History``\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThis is a completely rewritten version of Backbone's history designed to work with Spotify's URIs and ``ARGUMENTSCHANGED`` event. It needs to be passed a Spotify application object which has the `arguments` and `uri` properties loaded. You can then use it in the same way as Backbone's history:\\n    \\n    require('$api/models', function(models) {\\n      models.application.load(['arguments', 'uri']).done(function(application) {\\n        Backbone.history = new BackboneSpotify.History({application: application});\\n        var router = new Router();\\n        Backbone.history.start();\\n      });\\n    });\\n\\nIt's a bit smarter than the normal Backbone history, though. It keeps a stack of visited pages, similar to how a normal browser does. When you navigate to a new page, a reference to the view on the previous page is kept so it can be restored when you press the back button. (The example app shows you how to to restore scroll position with this.)\\n\\nSpotify doesn't actually tell us whether the user used the back or forward button, but we can guess. If the URI is changed to something which is one position down in the stack, we assume they clicked the back button. One position up, and they probably hit the next button.\\n\\nTo activate the history stack, you need to set a ``view`` property on your router which is a reference to the view for the current page. When you navigate to new page, this reference is stored in the stack.\\n\\n### Freezing and restoring views\\n\\nWhen a view is stored in the stack, a ``freeze`` method is called on the router and the view. (The router gets passed the view as an argument too.)\\n\\nSimilarly, when a view is restored by hitting the back or forward button, a ``restore`` method is called on the router and the view. \\n\\nSee the example app for how you can use these methods. Note that they get called **after** the URI is routed.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nThis is a basic example of a router that uses the history stack:\\n\\n    var Router = BackboneSpotify.Router.extend({\\n        routes: {\\n            'index': 'index',\\n            'other': 'other',\\n        },\\n\\n        index: function() {\\n            this.restore(new IndexView());\\n            this.view.render();\\n        },\\n\\n        other: function() {\\n            this.restore(new OtherView());\\n            this.view.render();\\n        },\\n\\n        restore: function(view) {\\n            this.view = view;\\n            $('.content').html(this.view.$el);\\n        },\\n    });\\n\\nTest suite\\n----------\\n\\nOpen up `test/index.html` in a browser.\\n\\nChange log\\n----------\\n\\n### 1.1.0\\n\\n - Support for [Spotify apps API 1.0.0](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/upgrade-guide/1.0.0).\\n\\n### 1.0.0\\n\\n - Initial release.\\n\\n\\nContributors\\n------------\\n\\n - [Ben Firshman](https://github.com/bfirsh)\\n - [Andreas Jansson](https://github.com/andreasjansson)\\n - [Tom Jakubowski](https://github.com/tomjakubowski)\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

My first encounter with data science occurred when I worked as a student researcher at the Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory (Fluminense Federal University) in which I built Artificial Neural Network models for power forecast.\\n\\nThereafter, I won a scholarship that allowed me to study at the University of Toronto in Canada. After this experience, I was given the opportunity to work with electrical projects and project management in a small company in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My third working contract involved tasks related to the project management of two electrical substation construction projects in a multinational company.\\n\\nRight now, I’m currently working on projects related to machine learning and data science which includes customer segmentation, sales prediction and plagiarism detection.\\n'}]"

For most use cases, you\\\\\\'ll\\\\nwant to use the authorization code flow.  This package includes an `Authenticator`\\\\ntype to handle the details for you.\\\\n\\\\nStart by registering your application at the following page:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll get a __client ID__ and __secret key__ for your application.  An easy way to\\\\nprovide this data to your application is to set the SPOTIFY_ID and SPOTIFY_SECRET\\\\nenvironment variables.  If you choose not to use environment variables, you can\\\\nprovide this data manually.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n````Go\\\\n// the redirect URL must be an exact match of a URL you\\\\\\'ve registered for your application\\\\n// scopes determine which permissions the user is prompted to authorize\\\\nauth := spotifyauth.New(spotifyauth.WithRedirectURL(redirectURL), spotifyauth.WithScopes(spotifyauth.ScopeUserReadPrivate))\\\\n\\\\n// get the user to this URL - how you do that is up to you\\\\n// you should specify a unique state string to identify the session\\\\nurl := auth.AuthURL(state)\\\\n\\\\n// the user will eventually be redirected back to your redirect URL\\\\n// typically you\\\\\\'ll have a handler set up like the following:\\\\nfunc redirectHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\\\\n      // use the same state string here that you used to generate the URL\\\\n      token, err := auth.Token(r.Context(), state, r)\\\\n      if err != nil {\\\\n            http.Error(w, \"Couldn\\\\\\'t get token\", http.StatusNotFound)\\\\n            return\\\\n      }\\\\n      // create a client using the specified token\\\\n      client := spotify.New(auth.Client(r.Context(), token))\\\\n\\\\n      // the client can now be used to make authenticated requests\\\\n}\\\\n````\\\\n\\\\nYou may find the following resources useful:\\\\n\\\\n1. Spotify\\\\\\'s Web API Authorization Guide:\\\\nhttps://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/\\\\n\\\\n2. Go\\\\\\'s OAuth2 package:\\\\nhttps://godoc.org/golang.org/x/oauth2/google\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Helpful Hints\\\\n\\\\n### Automatic Retries\\\\n\\\\nThe API will throttle your requests if you are sending them too rapidly.\\\\nThe client can be configured to wait and re-attempt the request.\\\\nTo enable this, set the `AutoRetry` field on the `Client` struct to `true`.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see Spotify [rate-limits](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/user-guide/#rate-limiting).\\\\n\\\\n## API Examples\\\\n\\\\nExamples of the API can be found in the [examples](examples) directory.\\\\n\\\\nYou may find tools such as [Spotify\\\\\\'s Web API Console](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/)\\\\nor [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/package/SpotifyPublicAPI/functions?utm_source=SpotifyGitHub&utm_medium=button&utm_content=Vendor_GitHub)\\\\nvaluable for experimenting with the API.\\\\n\\\\n### Missing data in responses\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s extremely common that when there is no market information available in your\\\\nrequest, that the Spotify API will simply return null for details about a track\\\\nor episode.\\\\n\\\\nThis typically occurs when you are just using an application\\\\\\'s auth token, and\\\\naren\\\\\\'t impersonating a user via oauth. As when you are using a token associated\\\\nwith a user, the user\\\\\\'s market seems to be extracted from their profile and\\\\nused when producing the response.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'spotDL/spotify-downloader\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'<!--- mdformat-toc start --slug=github --->\\\\n\\\\n<!--- \\\\n!!!

If however you\\\\\\'re using an AUR helper you can install directly from that, for example (in the case of [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)), run\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nyay -S spotify-tui\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Nix\\\\n\\\\nAvailable as the package `spotify-tui`. To install run:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nnix-env -iA nixpkgs.spotify-tui\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhere `nixpkgs` is the channel name in your configuration. For a more up-to-date installation, use the unstable channel.\\\\nIt is also possible to add the package to `environment.systemPackages` (for NixOS), or `home.packages` when using [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager).\\\\n\\\\n### Void Linux\\\\n\\\\nAvailable on the official repositories. To install, run\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsudo xbps-install -Su spotify-tui\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Fedora/CentOS\\\\n\\\\nAvailable on the [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/spotify-tui/) repositories. To install, run\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsudo dnf copr enable atim/spotify-tui -y && sudo dnf install spotify-tui\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Cargo\\\\n\\\\nUse this option if your architecture is not supported by the pre-built binaries found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases).\\\\n\\\\nFirst, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\ncargo install spotify-tui\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis method will build the binary from source.\\\\n\\\\nTo update, run the same command again.\\\\n\\\\n#### Note on Linux\\\\n\\\\nFor compilation on Linux the development packages for `libssl` are required.\\\\nFor basic installation instructions, see [install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic).\\\\nIn order to locate dependencies, the compilation also requires `pkg-config` to be installed.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you\\\\\\'ll need to [install additional dependencies](#windows-subsystem-for-linux).\\\\n\\\\n### Windows 10\\\\n\\\\n#### Scoop installer\\\\n\\\\nFirst, make sure scoop installer is on your windows box, for instruction please visit [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)\\\\n\\\\nThen open powershell and run following two commands:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nscoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/Rigellute/scoop-bucket\\\\nscoop install spotify-tui\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAfter that program is available as: `spt` or `spt.exe`\\\\n\\\\n### Manual\\\\n\\\\n1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases) for your OS.\\\\n1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and unzip\\\\n1. `cd` to `spotify-tui` and run with `./spt`\\\\n\\\\n## Connecting to Spotify’s API\\\\n\\\\n`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by\\\\nname, play tracks etc.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.\\\\n\\\\nBut here they are again:\\\\n\\\\n1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)\\\\n1. Click `Create an app`\\\\n    - You now can see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`\\\\n1. Now click `Edit Settings`\\\\n1. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs\\\\n1. Scroll down and click `Save`\\\\n1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!\\\\n1. Go back to the terminal\\\\n1. Run `spt`\\\\n1. Enter your `Client ID`\\\\n1. Enter your `Client Secret`\\\\n1. Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port\\\\n1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.\\\\n1. After accepting the permissions, you\\\\\\'ll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you\\\\\\'re done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you\\\\\\'ll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like \"Connection Refused\" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.\\\\n\\\\nAnd now you are ready to use the `spotify-tui` 🎉\\\\n\\\\nYou can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`. (for snap `${HOME}/snap/spt/current/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`)\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\nThe binary is named `spt`.\\\\n\\\\nRunning `spt` with no arguments will bring up the UI. Press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.\\\\nThere is also a CLI that is able to do most of the stuff the UI does. Use `spt --help` to learn more.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example to get you excited.\\\\n```\\\\nspt --completions zsh # Prints shell completions for zsh to stdout (bash, power-shell and more are supported)\\\\n\\\\nspt play --name \"Your Playlist\" --playlist --random # Plays a random song from \"Your Playlist\"\\\\nspt play --name \"A cool song\" --track # Plays \\\\\\'A cool song\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nspt playback --like --shuffle # Likes the current song and toggles shuffle mode\\\\nspt playback --toggle # Plays/pauses the current playback\\\\n\\\\nspt list --liked --limit 50 # See your liked songs (50 is the max limit)\\\\n\\\\n# Looks for \\\\\\'An even cooler song\\\\\\' and gives you the \\\\\\'{name} from {album}\\\\\\' of up to 30 matches\\\\nspt search \"An even cooler song\" --tracks --format \"%t from %b\" --limit 30\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Configuration\\\\n\\\\nA configuration file is located at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`, for snap `${HOME}/snap/spt/current/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`\\\\n(not to be confused with client.yml which handles spotify authentication)\\\\n\\\\nThe following is a sample config.yml file:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n# Sample config file\\\\n\\\\n# The theme colours can be an rgb string of the form \"255, 255, 255\" or a string that references the colours from your terminal theme: Reset, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Gray, DarkGray, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow, LightBlue, LightMagenta, LightCyan, White.\\\\ntheme:\\\\n  active: Cyan # current playing song in list\\\\n  banner: LightCyan # the \"spotify-tui\" banner on launch\\\\n  error_border: Red # error dialog border\\\\n  error_text: LightRed # error message text (e.g. \"Spotify API reported error 404\")\\\\n  hint: Yellow # hint text in errors\\\\n  hovered: Magenta # hovered pane border\\\\n  inactive: Gray # borders of inactive panes\\\\n  playbar_background: Black # background of progress bar\\\\n  playbar_progress: LightCyan # filled-in part of the progress bar\\\\n  playbar_progress_text: Cyan # song length and time played/left indicator in the progress bar\\\\n  playbar_text: White # artist name in player pane\\\\n  selected: LightCyan # a) selected pane border, b) hovered item in list, & c) track title in player\\\\n  text: \"255, 255, 255\" # text in panes\\\\n  header: White # header text in panes (e.g. \\\\\\'Title\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Artist\\\\\\', etc.)\\\\n\\\\nbehavior:\\\\n  seek_milliseconds: 5000\\\\n  volume_increment: 10\\\\n  # The lower the number the higher the \"frames per second\". You can decrease this number so that the audio visualisation is smoother but this can be expensive!\\\\n  tick_rate_milliseconds: 250\\\\n  # Enable text emphasis (typically italic/bold text styling).

So you\\\\\\'ll need either an official Spotify client open or a lighter weight alternative such as [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.\\\\n\\\\n## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)\\\\n\\\\nFollow the spotifyd documentation to get set up.\\\\n\\\\nAfter that there is not much to it.\\\\n\\\\n1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.\\\\n1. Start up `spt`\\\\n1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd \"device\" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)\\\\n\\\\n## Libraries used\\\\n\\\\n- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)\\\\n- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)\\\\n\\\\n## Development\\\\n\\\\n1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)\\\\n1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\\\\n1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)\\\\n1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it\\\\n1. And then `cargo run`\\\\n\\\\n### Windows Subsystem for Linux\\\\n\\\\nYou might get a linking error. If so, you\\\\\\'ll probably need to install additional dependencies required by the clipboard package\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsudo apt-get install -y -qq pkg-config libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Contributors\\\\n\\\\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji

You might also find it useful to resort to the **[full-length PDF version of the website](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/spotify-prototype.pdf)** as reference.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Fork this repo\\\\n- Clone this repo\\\\n\\\\n## Submission\\\\n\\\\nUpon completion, run the following commands:\\\\n\\\\n```shell\\\\n$ git add .\\\\n$ git commit -m \"done\"\\\\n$ git push origin master\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nCreate Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.\\\\n\\\\n## Instructions\\\\n\\\\nYou are provided with some assets - in the `images` folder, you will find the necessary images, and the text is ready for you in the `index.html` file. Write your HTML and CSS code in the `index.html` and `styles/style.css` files, respectively. Remember to follow the best practices.\\\\n\\\\nThe page is split into 4 sections, and we have generously cut it down into pieces!\\\\n\\\\nIn general, website designs don\\\\\\'t just come out the wild, so you will most likely be having mockups/sketches that you will have to integrate. It is a good practice to help you out before coding to cut the website into pieces in order to help you out _**structuring**_ your HTML.\\\\n\\\\n_**The last section isn\\\\\\'t as detailed as the others ones, good luck**_ :smile:\\\\n\\\\n:muscle: :muscle: :muscle:\\\\n<br>\\\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ihwebdeb/image/upload/v1571085836/Ironhack/spotify-prototype_1x_ahk8ep.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s do this!\\\\n\\\\n### Iteration 1: Navbar\\\\n\\\\n- The navbar should be `position: fixed`.\\\\n- Align the logo to the left and the `ul` with the links to the right, either using `float` or `flex`.\\\\n\\\\n### Iteration 2: Large image background with text\\\\n\\\\n- Check out [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) on centering things.\\\\n\\\\n### Iteration 3: What is on Spotify section\\\\n\\\\n- It looks like the `div`s take up about a third of the container each. How can you represent this in code?\\\\n\\\\n### Iteration 4: The green section\\\\n\\\\n- It looks like we have 2 main sections, a containing element with the text flowing from top to bottom, and the image of the Spotify player on the right.\\\\n- Position the Spotify logo absolutely according to the _green_ `div`.\\\\n\\\\nHappy coding! :heart:\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'librespot-org/librespot\\', \\'language\\': \\'Rust\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'[![Build Status](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/actions)\\\\n[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/librespot-org/librespot.png)](https://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources)\\\\n[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/librespot.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/librespot)\\\\n\\\\nCurrent maintainers are [listed on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/librespot-org/people).\\\\n\\\\n# librespot\\\\n*librespot* is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables applications to use Spotify\\\\\\'s service to control and play music via various backends, and to act as a Spotify Connect receiver. It is an alternative to the official and [now deprecated](https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/#libspotify-s-deprecation) closed-source `libspotify`. Additionally, it will provide extra features which are not available in the official library.\\\\n\\\\n_Note: librespot only works with Spotify Premium. This will remain the case. We will not support any features to make librespot compatible with free accounts, such as limited skips and adverts._\\\\n\\\\n## Quick start\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/librespot) as the _librespot_ package. Simply run `cargo install librespot` to install librespot on your system. Check the wiki for more info and possible [usage options](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).\\\\n\\\\nAfter installation, you can run librespot from the CLI using a command such as `librespot -n \"Librespot Speaker\" -b 160` to create a speaker called _Librespot Speaker_ serving 160 kbps audio.\\\\n\\\\n## This fork\\\\nAs the origin by [plietar](https://github.com/plietar/) is no longer actively maintained, this organisation and repository have been set up so that the project may be maintained and upgraded in the future.\\\\n\\\\n# Documentation\\\\nDocumentation is currently a work in progress, contributions are welcome!\\\\n\\\\nThere is some brief documentation on how the protocol works in the [docs](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/tree/master/docs) folder.\\\\n\\\\n[COMPILING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md) contains detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, and compiling librespot. More general usage and compilation information is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki).\\\\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) also contains our contributing guidelines.\\\\n\\\\nIf you wish to learn more about how librespot works overall, the best way is to simply read the code, and ask any questions you have in our [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources).\\\\n\\\\n# Issues & Discussions\\\\n**We have recently started using Github discussions for general questions and feature requests, as they are a more natural medium for such cases, and allow for upvoting to prioritize feature development. Check them out [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/discussions). Bugs and issues with the underlying library should still be reported as issues.**\\\\n\\\\nIf you run into a bug when using librespot, please search the existing issues before opening a new one. Chances are, we\\\\\\'ve encountered it before, and have provided a resolution. If not, please open a new one, and where possible, include the backtrace librespot generates on crashing, along with anything we can use to reproduce the issue, e.g. the Spotify URI of the song that caused the crash.\\\\n\\\\n# Building\\\\nA quick walkthrough of the build process is outlined below, while a detailed compilation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Additional Dependencies\\\\nWe recently switched to using [Rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) for audio playback by default, hence for macOS and Windows, you should just be able to clone and build librespot (with the command below).\\\\nFor Linux, you will need to run the additional commands below, depending on your distro.\\\\n\\\\nOn Debian/Ubuntu, the following command will install these dependencies:\\\\n```shell\\\\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nOn Fedora systems, the following command will install these dependencies:\\\\n```shell\\\\nsudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel make gcc\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nlibrespot currently offers the following selection of [audio backends](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends):\\\\n```\\\\nRodio (default)\\\\nALSA\\\\nGStreamer\\\\nPortAudio\\\\nPulseAudio\\\\nJACK\\\\nJACK over Rodio\\\\nSDL\\\\nPipe\\\\nSubprocess\\\\n```\\\\nPlease check the corresponding [Compiling](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies) entry on the wiki for backend specific dependencies.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\\\\\'ve installed the dependencies and cloned this repository you can build *librespot* with the default backend using Cargo.\\\\n```shell\\\\ncargo build --release\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Packages\\\\n\\\\nlibrespot is also available via official package system on various operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD. [Repology](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions) offers a good overview.\\\\n\\\\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/librespot.svg)](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions)\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\nA sample program implementing a headless Spotify Connect receiver is provided.\\\\nOnce you\\\\\\'ve built *librespot*, run it using :\\\\n```shell\\\\ntarget/release/librespot --name DEVICENAME\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe above is a minimal example. Here is a more fully fledged one:\\\\n```shell\\\\ntarget/release/librespot -n \"Librespot\" -b 320 -c ./cache --enable-volume-normalisation --initial-volume 75 --device-type avr\\\\n```\\\\nThe above command will create a receiver named ```Librespot```, with bitrate set to 320 kbps, initial volume at 75%, with volume normalisation enabled, and the device displayed in the app as an Audio/Video Receiver. A folder named ```cache``` will be created/used in the current directory, and be used to cache audio data and credentials.\\\\n\\\\nA full list of runtime options is available [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).\\\\n\\\\n_Please Note: When using the cache feature, an authentication blob is stored for your account in the cache directory. For security purposes, we recommend that you set directory permissions on the cache directory to `700`._\\\\n\\\\n## Contact\\\\nCome and hang out on gitter if you need help or want to offer some:\\\\nhttps://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources\\\\n\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\nUsing this code to connect to Spotify\\\\\\'s API is probably forbidden by them.\\\\nUse at your own risk.\\\\n\\\\n## License\\\\nEverything in this repository is licensed under the MIT license.\\\\n\\\\n## Related Projects\\\\nThis is a non exhaustive list of projects that either use or have modified librespot.

Also, we\\\\\\'ll be able to play a preview of some of these songs.\\\\n\\\\n<!-- To see the final product check out the deployed version: https://spotify-lab.herokuapp.com. -->\\\\n\\\\nIt may seem like a lot, but let\\\\\\'s break it down into steps!\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Fork this repo\\\\n- Clone this repo\\\\n\\\\n## Submission\\\\n\\\\n- Upon completion, run the following commands:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n$ git add .\\\\n$ git commit -m \"done\"\\\\n$ git push origin master\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.\\\\n\\\\n## The key helper: `spotify-web-api-node` npm package\\\\n\\\\nSpotify is great for streaming music from the app, but they also have a [Web Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) for us developers to play with.\\\\n\\\\nFor the purpose of this exercise, we will be using the [`spotify-web-api-node` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node) (this is the link that will take you to the documentation so go ahead and open it). As we can find in the docs, this package gives us simple methods to make requests to Spotify, and give us back artists, albums, tracks, and more.\\\\n\\\\n**In this lab, we have two main goals**:\\\\n\\\\n- We are going to apply our knowledge of GET method and when and why to use `req.query` and `req.params`.\\\\n- We are going to practice how to **read the documentation** (of this npm package particularly) and how to use the examples provided by the docs to successfully finish all the iterations.\\\\n\\\\n### Registering the app and getting the credentials\\\\n\\\\nThe **Spotify** API will need a `clientId` and `clientSecret` in order to give us permission to make requests and get some data back. To get `clientId` and `clientSecret`, we have to register our app on the official Spotify Developers web site (you won\\\\\\'t be charged for this, and no credit card information will be required). Let\\\\\\'s follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Navigate to [Spotify Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/).\\\\n2. Click on the \"Log In\" button. If you do not have an account, you will be asked to create one, it´s free :wink:.\\\\n3. After logging in, click on the **Create an App** button.\\\\n\\\\nThe following screens might be out of date, since Spotify is constantly iterating on their interface, but that shouldn\\\\\\'t stop you from completing these steps. You got this!\\\\n\\\\n<!-- ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_a3a19d215083c5526df1f53f3c1fdf6f.png) -->\\\\n\\\\n4. Fill the fields and submit the form.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_db933b4f08d71ceff0b0d5d4ca124594.png)\\\\n\\\\n5. We are ready to go! We have all the info we need :muscle: Let´s start!\\\\n\\\\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_8859d022ca1d53adc9f9ec829ec3d17b.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Iteration 1 | Spotify API Setup\\\\n\\\\nIn the next few steps, you\\\\\\'ll create all of the files that you need. So far, you have some basic setup in `app.js`, but that\\\\\\'s not quite enough. As you remember, to get some packages (including `express`) in our app, we have to have them in the `package.json` file. So let\\\\\\'s start listing the steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Let\\\\\\'s install all the dependencies we need to successfully run this app:\\\\n   `npm install express hbs spotify-web-api-node dotenv`.\\\\n2. `nodemon` is installed as a dev dependency (our app doesn\\\\\\'t depend on it but it helps us in the development process), which means we can use nodemon to run the app with: **`npm run dev`**.\\\\n\\\\n3. Inside of the `app.js` file, require `spotify-web-api-node`.\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nconst SpotifyWebApi = require(\\\\\\'spotify-web-api-node\\\\\\');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n4. Inside of the `app.js` file, you\\\\\\'ll find the place where you should paste the following code:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconst spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,\\\\n  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Retrieve an access token\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .clientCredentialsGrant()\\\\n  .then(data => spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']))\\\\n  .catch(error => console.log(\\\\\\'Something went wrong when retrieving an access token\\\\\\', error));\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n5. See this above?\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nconst spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,\\\\n  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTo avoid making our API keys public, we don\\\\\\'t want to add and commit them. We\\\\\\'ll use a package named `dotenv` for that.\\\\n\\\\nThis package is imported at the very beginning of `app.js`. All that is left to do is to add your keys in the `.env` file.\\\\nSo go ahead and create a `.env` file and paste the following lines there, replacing the text with your credentials.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nCLIENT_ID=your clientId goes here\\\\nCLIENT_SECRET=your clientSecret goes here\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n:zap: The `.env` is referred to in the `.gitignore` file so you\\\\\\'re safe!\\\\n\\\\n:fire: _Styling should be the last thing you focus on. Functionality first!_ 🙏🏻\\\\n\\\\n## Iteration 2 | Express Setup\\\\n\\\\nNow let\\\\\\'s create a `views` folder and let\\\\\\'s add the `layout.hbs` file in it.\\\\nAt this moment we should have the following structure of folders and files:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nlab-express-spotify\\\\n      ├── app.js\\\\n      ├── package.json\\\\n      ├── package-lock.json\\\\n      ├── public\\\\n      │\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  ├── images\\\\n      │\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  └── stylesheets\\\\n      │\\\\xa0\\\\xa0       └── style.css\\\\n      └── views\\\\n            └── layout.hbs\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAs we can see, in your _app.js_ we have required all the packages we need for now:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconst express = require(\\\\\\'express\\\\\\');\\\\nconst hbs = require(\\\\\\'hbs\\\\\\');\\\\nconst SpotifyWebApi = require(\\\\\\'spotify-web-api-node\\\\\\');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe are good to go. Let\\\\\\'s open the [spotify-web-api-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node) documentation and start our journey!\\\\n\\\\n## Iteration 3 | Search for an Artist\\\\n\\\\n**You can keep all your routes in the `app.js` after where it states: _// Our routes go here:_.**\\\\n\\\\n### Step 1 | Create a Homepage\\\\n\\\\nCreate a route that renders a simple home page. You\\\\\\'ll need a basic index route, that renders a home page. On this page, you should have a small search `form` that has an input field receiving an artist\\\\\\'s name and a button that submits the request.\\\\n\\\\nThis form should direct its query to `/artist-search` (`action=\"/artist-search\", method=\"GET\"`).\\\\nThe result should be something along these lines but leave styling for the end.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YuTA0vQ.png=400x)\\\\n\\\\n### Step 2 | Display results for artist search\\\\n\\\\nOkay, our search form submitted to `/artist-search` route. We still don\\\\\\'t have this route created so let\\\\\\'s do it!\\\\nThis route will receive the search term from the `query` string, and make a search request using one of the methods of the Spotify npm package. You have the documentation open :wink: but we will help you with your first step.\\\\n\\\\nThe method we will use from the npm package is: `spotifyApi.searchArtists()`. In this route, you should have something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .searchArtists(/*\\\\\\'HERE GOES THE QUERY ARTIST\\\\\\'*/)\\\\n  .then(data => {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The received data from the API: \\\\\\', data.body);\\\\n    // ----> \\\\\\'HERE WHAT WE WANT TO DO AFTER RECEIVING THE DATA FROM THE API\\\\\\'\\\\n  })\\\\n  .catch(err => console.log(\\\\\\'The error while searching artists occurred: \\\\\\', err));\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn order to display the found artists\\\\\\' information, create `artist-search-results.hbs` file inside `views` folder and display name, image, and button (or link) to show the albums for a particular artist on a new view (for now just create the button/link and we will take care of the rest in the next step). Again, styling is not your priority, so let\\\\\\'s move to the next step.\\\\n<br><br>\\\\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_9dc721e76158df1836ef07565b5385c2.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Iteration 4 | View Albums\\\\n\\\\nOn the `artist-search-results.hbs` page we created the `View albums` button/link. Users should be taken to _some other page_ after clicking on it and there be able to see all the albums of that particular artist. **Hint**: the URL should include artist\\\\\\'s `id` 🤓 and should change dynamically.\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<a href=\"/albums/someArtistIdGoesHere\">View Albums</a>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\\\\\'s create a new page - `albums.hbs` where all the results will be displayed. Make sure you show the _name_ and the _cover_ of each album and add a button/link to see the tracks (next iteration).\\\\n\\\\n:zap: Check out the `.getArtistAlbums()` method in the [spotify-web-api-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node) documentation.\\\\n\\\\n**Hint**:\\\\n\\\\nYour route should look like the following:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\napp.get(\\\\\\'/albums/:artistId\\\\\\', (req, res, next) => {\\\\n  // .getArtistAlbums() code goes here\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oaoqQMj.png)\\\\n\\\\nThis is going good so far, so let\\\\\\'s finish up with our last iteration.\\\\n\\\\n## Iteration 5 | View Tracks\\\\n\\\\nCreate the `View tracks` link on the albums page. This link should take you to a page with a list of all of the tracks on a particular album.\\\\n\\\\n**Hint**: The link to the tracks page should have each album\\\\\\'s _id_ in it. <br>\\\\n**Note**: :zap: Check out the `.getAlbumTracks()` method in the `spotify-web-api-node` documentation.\\\\n\\\\nA track object comes with a `preview_url`, which is the source for a 30-second preview of a particular song.

Handling credentials is described in detail in the Authorization section.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\\\\\'<your_access_token>\\\\\\');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nLastly, use the wrapper\\\\\\'s helper methods to make the request to Spotify\\\\\\'s Web API. The wrapper uses promises, so you need to provide a success callback as well as an error callback.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Get Elvis\\\\\\' albums\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Artist albums\\\\\\', data.body);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function(err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you dont wan\\\\\\'t to use promises, you can provide a callback method instead.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Get Elvis\\\\\\' albums\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\\\n  \\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\',\\\\n  { limit: 10, offset: 20 },\\\\n  function(err, data) {\\\\n    if (err) {\\\\n      console.error(\\\\\\'Something went wrong!\\\\\\');\\\\n    } else {\\\\n      console.log(data.body);\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe functions that fetch data from the API also accept a JSON object with a set of options. For example, `limit` and `offset` can be used in functions that returns paginated results, such as search and retrieving an artist\\\\\\'s albums.\\\\n\\\\nNote that the **options** parameter is **required if you\\\\\\'re using a callback method.**, even if it\\\\\\'s empty.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Passing a callback - get Elvis\\\\\\' albums in range [20...29]\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\', { limit: 10, offset: 20 })\\\\n  .then(\\\\n    function(data) {\\\\n      console.log(\\\\\\'Album information\\\\\\', data.body);\\\\n    },\\\\n    function(err) {\\\\n      console.error(err);\\\\n    }\\\\n  );\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Responses and errors\\\\n\\\\nThis exposes the response headers, status code and body. \\\\n\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \"body\" : {\\\\n\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"headers\" : {\\\\n\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"statusCode\" :\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nErrors have same fields, as well as a human readable `message`. This is especially useful since \\\\nSpotify\\\\\\'s Web API returns different types of error objects depending on the endpoint being called.\\\\n\\\\n#### Example of a response\\\\n\\\\nRetrieving a track\\\\\\'s metadata in `spotify-web-api-node` version 1.4.0 and later:\\\\n\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \"body\": {\\\\n    \"name\": \"Golpe Maestro\",\\\\n    \"popularity\": 42,\\\\n    \"preview_url\":\\\\n      \"https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/4ac44a56e3a4b7b354c1273d7550bbad38c51f5d\",\\\\n    \"track_number\": 1,\\\\n    \"type\": \"track\",\\\\n    \"uri\": \"spotify:track:3Qm86XLflmIXVm1wcwkgDK\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"headers\": {\\\\n    \"date\": \"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 09:25:48 GMT\",\\\\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json; charset=utf-8\",\\\\n    \"cache-control\": \"public, max-age=7200\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"statusCode\": 200\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### More examples\\\\n\\\\nBelow are examples for all helper functions. Longer examples of some requests can be found in the [examples folder](examples/). \\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nvar SpotifyWebApi = require(\\\\\\'spotify-web-api-node\\\\\\');\\\\n\\\\nvar spotifyApi

an access token is required for all requests to the Spotify API. This wrapper supports three authorization flows - The Authorization Code flow (signed by a user), the Client Credentials flow (application authentication - the user isn\\\\\\'t involved), and the Implicit Grant Flow (For completely clientside applications). See Spotify\\\\\\'s [Authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-web-api/authorization-guide/) for detailed information on these flows.\\\\n\\\\n**Important: If you are writing a universal/isomorphic web app using this library, you will not be able to use  methods that send a client secret to the Spotify authorization service. Client secrets should be kept server-side and not exposed to client browsers. Never include your client secret in the public JS served to the browser.**\\\\n\\\\nThe first thing you need to do is to [create an application](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/). A step-by-step tutorial is offered by Spotify in this [tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-web-api/tutorial/).\\\\n\\\\n#### Authorization code flow\\\\n\\\\nWith the application created and its redirect URI set, the only thing necessary for the application to retrieve an **authorization code** is the user\\\\\\'s permission. Which permissions you\\\\\\'re able to ask for is documented in Spotify\\\\\\'s [Using Scopes section](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-web-api/using-scopes/).\\\\n\\\\nIn order to get permissions, you need to direct the user to [Spotify\\\\\\'s Accounts service](https://accounts.spotify.com). Generate the URL by using the wrapper\\\\\\'s authorization URL method.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nvar scopes = [\\\\\\'user-read-private\\\\\\', \\\\\\'user-read-email\\\\\\'],\\\\n  redirectUri = \\\\\\'https://example.com/callback\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientId = \\\\\\'5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165\\\\\\',\\\\n  state = \\\\\\'some-state-of-my-choice\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\n// Setting credentials can be done in the wrapper\\\\\\'s constructor, or using the API object\\\\\\'s setters.\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  redirectUri: redirectUri,\\\\n  clientId: clientId\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Create the authorization URL\\\\nvar authorizeURL = spotifyApi.createAuthorizeURL(scopes, state);\\\\n\\\\n// https://accounts.spotify.com:443/authorize?client_id=5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&state=some-state-of-my-choice\\\\nconsole.log(authorizeURL);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe example below uses a hardcoded authorization code, retrieved from the Accounts service as described above.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nvar credentials = {\\\\n  clientId: \\\\\\'someClientId\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientSecret: \\\\\\'someClientSecret\\\\\\',\\\\n  redirectUri: \\\\\\'http://www.michaelthelin.se/test-callback\\\\\\'\\\\n};\\\\n\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi(credentials);\\\\n\\\\n// The code that\\\\\\'s returned as a query parameter to the redirect URI\\\\nvar code = \\\\\\'MQCbtKe23z7YzzS44KzZzZgjQa621hgSzHN\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\n// Retrieve an access token and a refresh token\\\\nspotifyApi.authorizationCodeGrant(code).then(\\\\n  function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The token expires in \\\\\\' + data.body[\\\\\\'expires_in\\\\\\']);\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The access token is \\\\\\' + data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The refresh token is \\\\\\' + data.body[\\\\\\'refresh_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n\\\\n    // Set the access token on the API object to use it in later calls\\\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n    spotifyApi.setRefreshToken(data.body[\\\\\\'refresh_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function(err) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Something went wrong!\\\\\\', err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSince the access token was set on the API object in the previous success callback, **it\\\\\\'s going to be used in future calls**. As it was retrieved using the Authorization Code flow, it can also be refreshed.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// clientId, clientSecret and refreshToken has been set on the api object previous to this call.\\\\nspotifyApi.refreshAccessToken().then(\\\\n  function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The access token has been refreshed!\\\\\\');\\\\n\\\\n    // Save the access token so that it\\\\\\'s used in future calls\\\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function(err) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Could not refresh access token\\\\\\', err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Client Credential flow\\\\n\\\\nThe Client Credential flow doesn\\\\\\'t require the user to give permissions, so it\\\\\\'s suitable for requests where the application just needs to authenticate itself. This is the case with for example retrieving a playlist. However, note that the access token cannot be refreshed, and that it isn\\\\\\'t connected to a specific user.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nvar clientId = \\\\\\'someClientId\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientSecret = \\\\\\'someClientSecret\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\n// Create the api object with the credentials\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  clientId: clientId,\\\\n  clientSecret: clientSecret\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Retrieve an access token.\\\\nspotifyApi.clientCredentialsGrant().then(\\\\n  function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The access token expires in \\\\\\' + data.body[\\\\\\'expires_in\\\\\\']);\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The access token is \\\\\\' + data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n\\\\n    // Save the access token so that it\\\\\\'s used in future calls\\\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function(err) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Something went wrong when retrieving an access token\\\\\\', err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Implicit Grant flow\\\\n\\\\nThe Implicit Grant can be used to allow users to login to your completely client-side application. This method still requires a registered application, but won\\\\\\'t expose your client secret.\\\\nThis method of authentication won\\\\\\'t return any refresh tokens, so you will need to fully reauthenticate the user everytime a token expires.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nvar scopes = [\\\\\\'user-read-private\\\\\\', \\\\\\'user-read-email\\\\\\'],\\\\n  redirectUri = \\\\\\'https://example.com/callback\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientId = \\\\\\'5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165\\\\\\',\\\\n  state = \\\\\\'some-state-of-my-choice\\\\\\',\\\\n  showDialog = true,\\\\n  responseType = \\\\\\'token\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\n// Setting credentials can be done in the wrapper\\\\\\'s constructor, or using the API object\\\\\\'s setters.\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  redirectUri: redirectUri,\\\\n  clientId: clientId\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Create the authorization URL\\\\nvar authorizeURL = spotifyApi.createAuthorizeURL(\\\\n  scopes,\\\\n  state,\\\\n  showDialog,\\\\n  responseType\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=5fe01282e44241328a84e7c5cc169165&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&state=some-state-of-my-choice&show_dialog=true\\\\nconsole.log(authorizeURL);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen the client returns, it will have a token we can directly pass to the library:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// The code that\\\\\\'s returned as a hash fragment query string parameter to the redirect URI\\\\nvar code = \\\\\\'MQCbtKe23z7YzzS44KzZzZgjQa621hgSzHN\\\\\\';\\\\nvar credentials = {\\\\n  clientId: \\\\\\'someClientId\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientSecret: \\\\\\'someClientSecret\\\\\\',\\\\n  //Either here\\\\n  accessToken: code\\\\n};\\\\n\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi(credentials);\\\\n\\\\n//Or with a method\\\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(code);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Setting credentials\\\\n\\\\nCredentials are either set when constructing the API object or set after the object has been created using setters. They can be set all at once or one at a time.\\\\n\\\\nUsing setters, getters and resetters.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Use setters to set all credentials one by one\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\\\\\'myAccessToken\\\\\\');\\\\nspotifyApi.setRefreshToken(\\\\\\'myRefreshToken\\\\\\');\\\\nspotifyApi.setRedirectURI(\\\\\\'http://www.example.com/test-callback\\\\\\');\\\\nspotifyApi.setClientId(\\\\\\'myOwnClientId\\\\\\');\\\\nspotifyApi.setClientSecret(\\\\\\'someSuperSecretString\\\\\\');\\\\n\\\\n// Set all credentials at the same time\\\\nspotifyApi.setCredentials({\\\\n  accessToken: \\\\\\'myAccessToken\\\\\\',\\\\n  refreshToken: \\\\\\'myRefreshToken\\\\\\',\\\\n  redirectUri: \\\\\\'http://www.example.com/test-callback\\\\\\',\\\\n  \\\\\\'clientId \\\\\\': \\\\\\'myClientId\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientSecret: \\\\\\'myClientSecret\\\\\\'\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Get the credentials one by one\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\\'The access token is \\\\\\' + spotifyApi.getAccessToken());\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\\'The refresh token is \\\\\\' + spotifyApi.getRefreshToken());\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\\'The redirectURI is \\\\\\' + spotifyApi.getRedirectURI());\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\\'The client ID is \\\\\\' + spotifyApi.getClientId());\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\\'The client secret is \\\\\\' + spotifyApi.getClientSecret());\\\\n\\\\n// Get all credentials\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\\'The credentials are \\\\\\' + spotifyApi.getCredentials());\\\\n\\\\n// Reset the credentials\\\\nspotifyApi.resetAccessToken();\\\\nspotifyApi.resetRefreshToken();\\\\nspotifyApi.resetRedirectURI();\\\\nspotifyApi.resetClientId();\\\\nspotifyApi.resetClientSecret();\\\\nspotifyApi.resetCode();\\\\n\\\\n// Reset all credentials at the same time\\\\nspotifyApi.resetCredentials();\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nUsing the constructor.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Set necessary parts of the credentials on the constructor\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  clientId: \\\\\\'myClientId\\\\\\',\\\\n  clientSecret: \\\\\\'myClientSecret\\\\\\'\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Get an access token and \\\\\\'save\\\\\\' it using a setter\\\\nspotifyApi.clientCredentialsGrant().then(\\\\n  function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'The access token is \\\\\\' + data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n    spotifyApi.setAccessToken(data.body[\\\\\\'access_token\\\\\\']);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function(err) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Something went wrong!\\\\\\', err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Set the credentials when making the request\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  accessToken: \\\\\\'njd9wng4d0ycwnn3g4d1jm30yig4d27iom5lg4d3\\\\\\'\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Do search using the access token\\\\nspotifyApi.searchTracks(\\\\\\'artist:Love\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(data.body);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function(err) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Something went wrong!\\\\\\', err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Set the credentials when making the request\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi({\\\\n  accessToken: \\\\\\'njd9wng4d0ycwnn3g4d1jm30yig4d27iom5lg4d3\\\\\\'\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// Get tracks in a playlist\\\\napi\\\\n  .getPlaylistTracks(\\\\\\'3ktAYNcRHpazJ9qecm3ptn\\\\\\', {\\\\n    offset: 1,\\\\n    limit: 5,\\\\n    fields: \\\\\\'items\\\\\\'\\\\n  })\\\\n  .then(\\\\n    function(data) {\\\\n      console.log(\\\\\\'The playlist contains these tracks\\\\\\', data.body);\\\\n    },\\\\n    function(err) {\\\\n      console.log(\\\\\\'Something went wrong!\\\\\\', err);\\\\n    }\\\\n  );\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Development\\\\n\\\\nSee something you think can be improved?

That is the reason I started this project.\\\\n\\\\nI found that there weren\\\\\\'t many resources on building a proper real-world scale application, and that\\\\\\'s my focus for sharing. I made a [Jira clone application][jira] as the first one for that purpose. [Nx workspace][nx] is getting more and more attention from the Angular community, but people are always confused about how to architect and set up an Nx project. I hope Angular Spotify will give you more insight on that even though it is my first project using Nx 🤣\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nYou know I am one of the moderators of [Angular Vietnam][angularvn]. Recently, I also started [Angular Singapore][angularsg]. This piece of work is my other long-term plan to bring Angular knowledge to more people. I desire to advocate and grow the Angular developer community in Singapore and Vietnam :)\\\\n\\\\n## Tech stack\\\\n\\\\n![Tech logos][stack]\\\\n\\\\n- [Angular 12][angular]\\\\n- [Nx Workspace][nx]\\\\n- [ngneat][] packages includes: `ngneat/svg-icon` and `ngneat/until-destroy`\\\\n- [ngrx][ngrx] and [ngrx/component-store][component-store]\\\\n- [ng-zorro][ng-zorro] UI component: `tooltip`, `modal`, `slider`, `switch` and more.\\\\n- [TailwindCSS][tailwind] - See this video [Everything you need to know about TailwindCSS and Angular applications](https://youtu.be/zSXdJqEPy9w) by [@nartc][nartc] for integration TailwindCSS with Angular\\\\n- [Netlify][netlify] for deployment\\\\n\\\\n[angular]: https://angular.io/\\\\n[ngrx]: https://ngrx.io/\\\\n[component-store]: https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store\\\\n[tailwind]: https://tailwindcss.com/\\\\n[ng-zorro]: https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en\\\\n[netlify]: http://netlify.com/\\\\n[ngneat]: https://github.com/ngneat\\\\n\\\\nI experimented with the ngrx/component store for `AuthStore` and `UIStore`. It might not be a best practice, and I will refactor it very soon. Just FYI 🤣\\\\n\\\\n## High-level design\\\\n\\\\nSee my original notes on [Nx workspace structure for NestJS and Angular][gist]\\\\n\\\\n### Principles\\\\n\\\\nAll components are following:\\\\n\\\\n- OnPush Change Detection and async pipes: all components use observable and async pipe for rendering data without any single manual subscribe. Only some places are calling subscribe for dispatching an action, which I will have a refactor live stream session with my friend [@nartc][nartc] to use the component store for a fully subscribe-less application.\\\\n- SCAMs (single component Angular modules) for tree-shakable components, meaning each component will have a respective module. For example, a RegisterComponent will have a corresponding RegisterModule. We won\\\\\\'t declare RegisterComponent as part of AuthModule, for instance.\\\\n- Mostly, everything will stay in the `libs` folder. New modules, new models, new configurations, new components etc... are in libs. libs should be separated into different directories based on existing apps. We won\\\\\\'t put them inside the apps folder. For example in an Angular, contains the `main.ts`, `app.component.ts` and `app.module.ts`\\\\n\\\\n### Structure\\\\n\\\\nI followed the structure recommended by my friend [@nartc][nartc]. Below is the simplified version of the application structure.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n.\\\\n└── root\\\\n    ├── apps\\\\n    │   └── angular-spotify\\\\n    └── libs\\\\n        └── web (dir)\\\\n            ├── shell (dir)\\\\n            │   ├── feature (angular:lib) - for configure any forRoot modules\\\\n            │   └── ui\\\\n            │       └── layout (angular:lib)\\\\n            ├── settings (dir)\\\\n            │   ├── feature (angular:lib) - for configure and persist all settings\\\\n            │   └── data-access (workspace:lib) - store and services for settings module\\\\n            ├── playlist (dir)\\\\n            │   ├── data-access (angular:lib, service, state management)\\\\n            │   ├── features\\\\n            │   │   ├── list (angular:lib PlaylistsComponent)\\\\n            │   │   └── detail (angular:lib PlaylistDetailComopnent)\\\\n            │   └── ui (dir)\\\\n            │       └── playlist-track (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\\\n            ├── visualizer (dir)\\\\n            │   ├── data-access (angular:lib)\\\\n            │   ├── feature\\\\n            │   └── ui (angular:lib)\\\\n            ├── home (dir)\\\\n            │   ├── data-access (angular:lib)\\\\n            │   ├── feature (angular:lib)\\\\n            │   └── ui (dir)\\\\n            │       ├── featured-playlists (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\\\n            │       ├── greeting (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\\\n            │       └── recent-played (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)\\\\n            └── shared (dir)\\\\n                ├── app-config (injection token for environment)\\\\n                ├── data-access (angular:lib, API call, Service or State management to share across the Client app)\\\\n                ├── ui (dir)\\\\n                ├── pipes (dir)\\\\n                ├── directives (dir)\\\\n                └── utils (angular:lib, usually shared Guards, Interceptors, Validators...)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Authentication Flow\\\\n\\\\nI follow `Implicit Grant Flow` that Spotify recommended for client-side only applications and did not involve secret keys. The issued access tokens are short-lived, and there are no refresh tokens to extend them when they expire.\\\\n\\\\nView the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)\\\\n\\\\n- Upon opening Angular Spotify, It will redirect you to Spotify to get access to your data. Angular Spotify only uses the data purely for displaying on the UI. We won\\\\\\'t store your information anywhere else.\\\\n- Angular Spotify only keeps the access token in the browser memory without even storing it into browser local storage. If you do a hard refresh on the browser, It will ask for a new access token from Spotify. One access token is only valid for **one hour**.\\\\n- After having the token, I\\\\\\'ll try to connect to the Web Playback SDK with a new player - `Angular Spotify Web Player`\\\\n\\\\n![Angular Spotify Web Playback SDK flow][sdk-flow]\\\\n\\\\n### Dependency Graph\\\\n\\\\nNx provides an [dependency graph][dep-graph-nx] out of the box. To view it on your browser, clone my repository and run:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nnpm run dep-graph\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nA simplified graph looks like the following. It gives you insightful information for your mono repo and is especially helpful when multiple projects depend on each other.\\\\n\\\\n![Angular Spotify Dependency Graph][dep-graph]\\\\n\\\\n### Nx Computation Cache\\\\n\\\\nHaving Nx Cloud configured shortens the deployment time quite a lot.\\\\n\\\\nNx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly. Visit [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/) to learn more.\\\\n\\\\n![Nx cloud][nx-cloud]\\\\n\\\\n## Features and Roadmap\\\\n\\\\nI set a tentative deadline for motivating myself to finish the work on time. Otherwise, It will take forever to complete :)\\\\n\\\\n### 1.0 - Simple Spotify client\\\\n\\\\n> March 01 - 28, 2021\\\\n\\\\n- [x] Proven, scalable, and easy to understand the structure with Nx workspace\\\\n- [x] Play music using Spotify SDK\\\\n- [x] Load a maximum of 50 save playlists and top 100 songs per playlist.\\\\n- [x] Cool visualization\\\\n\\\\n## Live stream\\\\n\\\\nLet work on it together!\\\\n\\\\nI scheduled a few live stream sessions to show you how I continue developing Angular Spotify.

It includes helper functions for **all Spotify\\\\\\'s endpoints**, such as fetching metadata (search and look-up of albums, artists, tracks, playlists, new releases, podcasts) and user\\\\\\'s information (follow users, artists and playlists, and saved tracks management).\\\\n\\\\nIt doesn\\\\\\'t have any dependencies and supports callbacks and promises. It is intended to be run on a browser, but if you want to use Node.JS to make the requests, please check [spotify-web-api-node](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node).\\\\n\\\\nA list of selected wrappers for different languages and environments is available on the Developer site\\\\\\'s [Libraries page](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/code-examples/).\\\\n\\\\nThe wrapper includes helper functions to do the following:\\\\n\\\\n#### Music and Podcast metadata\\\\n\\\\n- Albums, artists, tracks and playlists\\\\n- Audio features and audio analysis for tracks\\\\n- Albums for a specific artist\\\\n- Top tracks for a specific artist\\\\n- Artists similar to a specific artist\\\\n- Shows and episodes (podcasts)\\\\n\\\\n#### Profiles\\\\n\\\\n- User\\\\\\'s emails, product type, display name, birthdate, image\\\\n\\\\n#### Search\\\\n\\\\n- Albums, artists, tracks, playlists, shows, and episodes\\\\n\\\\n#### Playlist Management\\\\n\\\\n- Get a user\\\\\\'s playlists\\\\n- Create playlists\\\\n- Change playlist details\\\\n- Add tracks to a playlist\\\\n- Remove tracks from a playlist\\\\n- Replace tracks in a playlist\\\\n- Reorder tracks in a playlist\\\\n- Upload custom playlist cover image\\\\n\\\\n#### User\\\\\\'s Library\\\\n\\\\n- Add, remove, and get tracks on a user\\\\\\'s library\\\\n- Check if a track is in the signed in user\\\\\\'s library\\\\n- Add, remove, and get shows (podcasts) on a user\\\\\\'s library\\\\n\\\\n#### Personalization\\\\n\\\\n- Get a user’s top artists and tracks based on calculated affinity\\\\n- Get current user’s recently played tracks\\\\n\\\\n#### Browse\\\\n\\\\n- Get new releases\\\\n- Get featured playlists\\\\n- Get a list of categories\\\\n- Get a category\\\\n- Get a category\\\\\\'s playlists\\\\n- Get recommendations based on seeds\\\\n- Get available genre seeds\\\\n\\\\n#### Follow\\\\n\\\\n- Follow and unfollow users\\\\n- Follow and unfollow artists\\\\n- Check if the logged in user follows a user or artist\\\\n- Follow a playlist\\\\n- Unfollow a playlist\\\\n- Get followed artists\\\\n- Check if users are following a Playlist\\\\n\\\\n#### Player\\\\n\\\\n- Get a user\\\\\\'s available devices\\\\n- Get information about the user\\\\\\'s current playback\\\\n- Get the user\\\\\\'s currently playing track\\\\n- Transfer a user\\\\\\'s playback\\\\n- Start/Resume a user\\\\\\'s playback\\\\n- Pause a user\\\\\\'s playback\\\\n- Skip user\\\\\\'s playback to next track\\\\n- Skip user\\\\\\'s playback to previous track\\\\n- Seek to position in currently playing track\\\\n- Set repeat mode on user\\\\\\'s playback\\\\n- Set volume for user\\\\\\'s playback\\\\n- Toggle shuffle for user\\\\\\'s playback\\\\n- Queue a track or an episode\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\nInstall via node (since the requests are made using XMLHttpRequest, you will need a tool like Browserify to run this on a browser):\\\\n\\\\n    $ npm install -S spotify-web-api-js\\\\n\\\\nThen, in your javascript file\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nvar Spotify = require(\\\\\\'spotify-web-api-js\\\\\\');\\\\nvar s = new Spotify();\\\\n//s.searchTracks()...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nor by making a copy of the `src/spotify-web-api.js` file\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend you have a look at the [documentation](https://jmperezperez.com/spotify-web-api-js/) to get an overview of the supported\\\\n.\\\\n\\\\nThe wrapper supports callback functions, as well as [Promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/) (you can also use [a polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise)), and Promises/A+ libraries such as [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) and [when](https://github.com/cujojs/when).\\\\n\\\\nFirst, instantiate the wrapper.\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you have an access token, you can set it doing:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\\\\\'<here_your_access_token>\\\\\\');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen you set an access token, it will be used for signing your requests. An access token is required for all endpoints.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to use a Promises/A+ library, you can set it:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nspotifyApi.setPromiseImplementation(Q);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHere you see how to get basic information using a function like `getArtistAlbums`:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n// get Elvis\\\\\\' albums, passing a callback. When a callback is passed, no Promise is returned\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\', function (err, data) {\\\\n  if (err) console.error(err);\\\\n  else console.log(\\\\\\'Artist albums\\\\\\', data);\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\n// get Elvis\\\\\\' albums, using Promises through Promise, Q or when\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Artist albums\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe promises also expose an `abort` method that aborts the XMLHttpRequest. This is useful to cancel\\\\nrequests that were made earlier and could be resolved out-of-sync:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nvar prev = null;\\\\n\\\\nfunction onUserInput(queryTerm) {\\\\n  // abort previous request, if any\\\\n  if (prev !== null) {\\\\n    prev.abort();\\\\n  }\\\\n\\\\n  // store the current promise in case we need to abort it\\\\n  prev = spotifyApi.searchTracks(queryTerm, { limit: 5 });\\\\n  prev.then(\\\\n    function (data) {\\\\n      // clean the promise so it doesn\\\\\\'t call abort\\\\n      prev = null;\\\\n\\\\n      // ...render list of search results...\\\\n    },\\\\n    function (err) {\\\\n      console.error(err);\\\\n    }\\\\n  );\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe functions that fetch data from the API support also an optional JSON object with a set of options, such as the ones regarding pagination. These options will be sent as query parameters:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n// passing a callback - get Elvis\\\\\\' albums in range [20...29]\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\\\n  \\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\',\\\\n  { limit: 10, offset: 20 },\\\\n  function (err, data) {\\\\n    if (err) console.error(err);\\\\n    else console.log(\\\\\\'Artist albums\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// using Promises through Promise, Q or when - get Elvis\\\\\\' albums in range [20...29]\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\', { limit: 10, offset: 20 })\\\\n  .then(\\\\n    function (data) {\\\\n      console.log(\\\\\\'Album information\\\\\\', data);\\\\n    },\\\\n    function (err) {\\\\n      console.error(err);\\\\n    }\\\\n  );\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### More examples\\\\n\\\\n_Note: The following examples use Promises/Q/when as the return object._\\\\n\\\\nHere you can see more examples of the usage of this wrapper:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n// get multiple albums\\\\nspotifyApi.getAlbums([\\\\\\'5U4W9E5WsYb2jUQWePT8Xm\\\\\\', \\\\\\'3KyVcddATClQKIdtaap4bV\\\\\\']).then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Albums information\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// get an artists\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtist(\\\\\\'2hazSY4Ef3aB9ATXW7F5w3\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Artist information\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// get multiple artists\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .getArtists([\\\\\\'2hazSY4Ef3aB9ATXW7F5w3\\\\\\', \\\\\\'6J6yx1t3nwIDyPXk5xa7O8\\\\\\'])\\\\n  .then(\\\\n    function (data) {\\\\n      console.log(\\\\\\'Artists information\\\\\\', data);\\\\n    },\\\\n    function (err) {\\\\n      console.error(err);\\\\n    }\\\\n  );\\\\n\\\\n// get albums by a certain artist\\\\nspotifyApi.getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Artist albums\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// search tracks whose name, album or artist contains \\\\\\'Love\\\\\\'\\\\nspotifyApi.searchTracks(\\\\\\'Love\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Search by \"Love\"\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// search artists whose name contains \\\\\\'Love\\\\\\'\\\\nspotifyApi.searchArtists(\\\\\\'Love\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Search artists by \"Love\"\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\n// search tracks whose artist\\\\\\'s name contains \\\\\\'Love\\\\\\'\\\\nspotifyApi.searchTracks(\\\\\\'artist:Love\\\\\\').then(\\\\n  function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'Search tracks by \"Love\" in the artist name\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  },\\\\n  function (err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Nesting calls\\\\n\\\\nWhen you need to make multiple calls to get some dataset, you can take advantage of the Promises to get a cleaner code:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n// track detail information for album tracks\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .getAlbum(\\\\\\'5U4W9E5WsYb2jUQWePT8Xm\\\\\\')\\\\n  .then(function (data) {\\\\n    return data.tracks.map(function (t) {\\\\n      return t.id;\\\\n    });\\\\n  })\\\\n  .then(function (trackIds) {\\\\n    return spotifyApi.getTracks(trackIds);\\\\n  })\\\\n  .then(function (tracksInfo) {\\\\n    console.log(tracksInfo);\\\\n  })\\\\n  .catch(function (error) {\\\\n    console.error(error);\\\\n  });\\\\n\\\\n// album detail for the first 10 Elvis\\\\\\' albums\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .getArtistAlbums(\\\\\\'43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\\\\\\', { limit: 10 })\\\\n  .then(function (data) {\\\\n    return data.albums.map(function (a) {\\\\n      return a.id;\\\\n    });\\\\n  })\\\\n  .then(function (albums) {\\\\n    return spotifyApi.getAlbums(albums);\\\\n  })\\\\n  .then(function (data) {\\\\n    console.log(data);\\\\n  });\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Getting user\\\\\\'s information\\\\n\\\\nIn order to get user\\\\\\'s information you need to request a user-signed access token, from either the Implicit Grant or Authorization Code flow. Say for instance you want to get user\\\\\\'s playlists. Once you get an access token, set it and fetch the data:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n// get an access token\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n// set it in the wrapper\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\\\\\'<here_your_access_token>\\\\\\');\\\\nspotifyApi.getUserPlaylists(\\\\\\'jmperezperez\\\\\\')\\\\n  .then(function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'User playlists\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  }, function(err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  });\\\\n\\\\nspotifyApi.getPlaylist(\\\\\\'4vHIKV7j4QcZwgzGQcZg1x\\\\\\')\\\\n  .then(function(data) {\\\\n    console.log(\\\\\\'User playlist\\\\\\', data);\\\\n  }, function(err) {\\\\n    console.error(err);\\\\n  });\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSome functions don\\\\\\'t need to receive the user\\\\\\'s id as a parameter, and will use the\\\\nuser\\\\\\'s information from the access token:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nvar spotifyApi = new SpotifyWebApi();\\\\nspotifyApi.setAccessToken(\\\\\\'<here_your_access_token>\\\\\\');\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .getUserPlaylists() // note that we don\\\\\\'t pass a user id\\\\n  .then(\\\\n    function (data) {\\\\n      console.log(\\\\\\'User playlists\\\\\\', data);\\\\n    },\\\\n    function (err) {\\\\n      console.error(err);\\\\n    }\\\\n  );\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Integrated Typescript Typings\\\\n\\\\nGet great code completion for this package using the integrated typescript typings. It includes the complete typings of the Spotify Web Api too, so you\\\\\\'ll know both how to the navigate the API as well as the response you are getting.\\\\n\\\\n![Typings Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js/master/typings-example.gif)\\\\n\\\\n### When bundling the library\\\\n\\\\nIf you are bundling spotify-web-api-js using e.g. webpack you can include the library and the typings into a typescript file like this:\\\\n\\\\n```typescript\\\\nimport SpotifyWebApi from \\\\\\'spotify-web-api-js\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nlet spotify = new SpotifyWebApi();\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### When using the library globally\\\\n\\\\nIf you are using the library globally, for example including directly from index.html, include the typings in the top of your typescript file. Typescript will then assume the library is already present globally. Adjust the path to `node_modules`.\\\\n\\\\n```typescript\\\\n/// <reference path=\"../node_modules/spotify-web-api-js/src/typings/spotify-web-api.d.ts\" />\\\\n\\\\nlet spotify = new SpotifyWebApi();\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Running tests\\\\n\\\\nIn order to run the tests, run:\\\\n\\\\n    $ npm test\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to check out the coverage, run:\\\\n\\\\n    $ npm run test:coverage\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'spotify/ios-sdk\\', \\'language\\': \\'Objective-C\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify iOS SDK\\\\n\\\\n## Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Spotify iOS framework allows your application to interact with the Spotify app running in the background on a user\\\\\\'s device. Capabilities include authorizing, getting metadata for the currently playing track and context, as well as issuing playback commands.\\\\n\\\\n**Please Note:** By using Spotify developer tools you accept our [Developer Terms of Use](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/terms/).\\\\n\\\\nThe Spotify iOS SDK is a set of lightweight objects that connect with the Spotify app and let you control it while all the heavy lifting of playback is offloaded to the Spotify app itself. The Spotify app takes care of playback, networking, offline caching and OS music integration, leaving you to focus on your user experience.  Moving from your app to the Spotify app and vice versa is a streamlined experience where playback and metadata always stay in sync.\\\\n\\\\n[Key Features](#key-features)\\\\n\\\\n[Filing Bugs](#filing-bugs)\\\\n\\\\n[Components](#components)\\\\n\\\\n[How Do App Remote Calls Work?](#how-do-app-remote-calls-work)\\\\n\\\\n[Terms of Use](#terms-of-use)\\\\n\\\\n[Tutorial](#tutorial)\\\\n\\\\n[Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\\\\n\\\\n### Key Features\\\\n\\\\n* Playback is always in sync with Spotify app\\\\n* Playback, networking, and caching is all accounted for by the Spotify app\\\\n* Works offline and online and does not require Web API calls to get metadata for player state\\\\n* Allows authentication through the Spotify app so users don\\\\\\'t have to type in their credentials\\\\n\\\\n### Filing Bugs\\\\n\\\\nWe love feedback from the developer community, so please feel free to file missing features or bugs over at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/spotify/ios-app-remote-sdk/issues).\\\\nMake sure you search existing issues before creating new ones.\\\\n\\\\n[Open bug tickets](https://github.com/spotify/ios-app-remote-sdk/labels/bug) | [Open feature requests](https://github.com/spotify/ios-app-remote-sdk/labels/feature%20request)\\\\n\\\\n### Requirements\\\\n\\\\nThe Spotify iOS framework requires a deployment target of iOS 9 or higher. The\\\\nfollowing architectures are supported: `armv7`, `armv7s` and `arm64` for devices,\\\\n`i386` and `x86_64` for the iOS Simulator. Bitcode is also supported.\\\\n\\\\n## Components\\\\n\\\\n### Models\\\\n\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteAlbum`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteArtist`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteLibraryState`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemotePlaybackRestrictions`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemotePlaybackOptions`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemotePlayerState`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteTrack`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteContentItem`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteUserCapabilities`\\\\n* `SPTAppRemoteImageRepresentable`\\\\n* `SPTConfiguration`\\\\n\\\\n### SPTAppRemote\\\\n\\\\nThe main entry point to connect to the Spotify app and retrieve API components. Use this to establish, monitor, and terminate the connection.\\\\n\\\\n### SPTAppRemotePlayerAPI\\\\n\\\\nSend playback related commands such as:\\\\n\\\\n* Play track by URI\\\\n* Resume/pause playback\\\\n* Skip forwards and backwards\\\\n* Seek to position\\\\n* Set shuffle on/off\\\\n* Request player state\\\\n* Request player context\\\\n* Subscribe to player state\\\\n\\\\n### SPTAppRemoteImagesAPI\\\\n\\\\nFetch an image for a `SPTAppRemoteImageRepresentable`\\\\n\\\\n### SPTAppRemoteUserAPI\\\\n\\\\nFetch/subscribe/set user-related data such as:\\\\n\\\\n* Fetch and/or subscribe to `SPTAppRemoteUserCapabilities`\\\\n* Determine if a user can play songs on demand (Premium vs Free)\\\\n* Add/remove/check if a song is in a user\\\\\\'s library\\\\n\\\\n### SPTAppRemoteContentAPI\\\\n\\\\nFetch recommended content for the user.\\\\n\\\\n## How App Remote calls work\\\\n\\\\nWhen you interact with any of the App Remote APIs you pass in a `SPTAppRemoteCallback` block that gets invoked with either the expected result item or an `NSError` if the operation failed. The block is triggered after the command was received by the Spotify app (or if the connection could not be made).\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example using the `SPTRemotePlayerAPI` to skip a song:\\\\n\\\\n```objective-c\\\\n[appRemote.playerAPI skipToNext:^(id  _Nullable result, NSError * _Nullable error) {\\\\n    if (error) {\\\\n        // Operation failed\\\\n    } else {\\\\n        // Operation succeeded\\\\n    }\\\\n}];\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Tutorial and Examples\\\\n\\\\nWe provide a few sample projects to help you get started with the iOS Framework in the DemoProjects folder. See the [Readme](DemoProjects/README.md) in the DemoProjects folder for more information on what each sample does.\\\\n\\\\n### Authentication and Authorization\\\\n\\\\nTo communicate with the Spotify app your application will need to get a user\\\\\\'s permission to control playback first by using built-in authorization for App Remote. To do that you will need to request authorization view when connecting to Spotify. The framework will automatically request the `app-remote-control` scope and show the auth view if user hasn\\\\\\'t agreed to it yet.\\\\n\\\\n## Terms of Use\\\\n\\\\nNote that by using Spotify developer tools, you accept our [Developer Terms of Use](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/terms/).\\\\n\\\\n### Included Open Source Libraries\\\\n\\\\n* [MPMessagePack](https://github.com/gabriel/MPMessagePack)\\\\n\\\\n## Tutorial\\\\n\\\\nThis tutorial leads you step-by-step through the creation of a simple app that uses the Spotify iOS SDK to play an audio track and subscribe to player state. It will walk through the authorization flow.\\\\n\\\\n### Prepare Your Environment\\\\n\\\\nFollow these steps to make sure you are prepared to start coding.\\\\n\\\\n* Download the Spotify iOS framework from the \"Clone or download\" button at the top of this page, and unzip it.\\\\n* Install the latest version of Spotify from the App Store onto the device you will be using for development. Run the Spotify app and login or sign up.\\\\n**Note:** A **Spotify Premium** account will be required to play a track on-demand for a uri.\\\\n* [Register Your Application](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app). You will need to register your application at [My Applications](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and obtain a client ID. When you register your app you will also need to whitelist a redirect URI that the Spotify app will use to callback to your app after authorization.\\\\n\\\\n### Add Dependencies\\\\n\\\\n1. Add the `SpotifyiOS.framework` or `SpotifyiOS.xcframework` to your Xcode project.\\\\n\\\\n    ![Import SpotifyiOS.framework](img/import_sdk.png)\\\\n\\\\n2. In your info.plist add your redirect URI you registered at [My Applications](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). You will need to add your redirect URI under \"URL types\" and \"URL Schemes\". Be sure to set a unique \"URL identifier\" as well. [More info on URL Schemes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1)\\\\n\\\\n    ![Info.plist](img/info_plist.png)\\\\n\\\\n3. Add `#import <SpotifyiOS/SpotifyiOS.h>` to your source files to import necessary headers.\\\\n\\\\n### Check if Spotify is Active\\\\n\\\\nIf a user is already using Spotify, but has not authorized your application, you can use the following check to prompt them to\\\\nstart the authorization process.\\\\n\\\\n```objective-c\\\\n[SPTAppRemote checkIfSpotifyAppIsActive:^(BOOL active) {\\\\n    if (active) {\\\\n        // Prompt the user to connect Spotify here\\\\n    }\\\\n}];\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Authorize Your Application\\\\n\\\\nTo be able to use the playback control part of the SDK the user needs to authorize your application. If they haven\\\\\\'t, the connection will fail with a `No token provided` error. To allow the user to authorize your app, you can use the built-in authorization flow.\\\\n\\\\n1. Initialize `SPTConfiguration` with your client ID and redirect URI.\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    SPTConfiguration *configuration =\\\\n        [[SPTConfiguration alloc] initWithClientID:@\"your_client_id\" redirectURL:[NSURL urlWithString:@\"your_redirect_uri\"]];\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n2. Initialize `SPTAppRemote` with your `SPTConfiguration`\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    self.appRemote = [[SPTAppRemote alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration logLevel:SPTAppRemoteLogLevelDebug];\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n3. Initiate the authentication flow (for other ways to detect if Spotify is installed, as well as attributing installs, please see our [Content Linking Guide](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/content-linking-guide/)).\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    // Note: A blank string will play the user\\\\\\'s last song or pick a random one.\\\\n    BOOL spotifyInstalled = [self.appRemote authorizeAndPlayURI:@\"spotify:track:69bp2EbF7Q2rqc5N3ylezZ\"];\\\\n    if (!spotifyInstalled) {\\\\n        /*\\\\n        * The Spotify app is not installed.\\\\n        * Use SKStoreProductViewController with [SPTAppRemote spotifyItunesItemIdentifier] to present the user\\\\n        * with a way to install the Spotify app.\\\\n        */\\\\n    }\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n4. Configure your `AppDelegate` to parse out the accessToken in `application:openURL:options:` and set it on the `SPTAppRemote` connectionParameters.\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options\\\\n    {\\\\n        NSDictionary *params = [self.appRemote authorizationParametersFromURL:url];\\\\n        NSString *token = params[SPTAppRemoteAccessTokenKey];\\\\n        if (token) {\\\\n            self.appRemote.connectionParameters.accessToken = token;\\\\n        } else if (params[SPTAppRemoteErrorDescriptionKey]) {\\\\n            NSLog(@\"%@\", params[SPTAppRemoteErrorDescriptionKey]);\\\\n        }\\\\n        return YES;\\\\n    }\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    If you are using UIScene then you need to use appropriate method in your scene delegate.\\\\n\\\\n    ```swift\\\\n    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {\\\\n        guard let url = URLContexts.first?.url else {\\\\n            return\\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\n        let parameters = appRemote.authorizationParameters(from: url);\\\\n\\\\n        if let access_token = parameters?[SPTAppRemoteAccessTokenKey] {\\\\n            appRemote.connectionParameters.accessToken = access_token\\\\n            self.accessToken = access_token\\\\n        } else if let error_description = parameters?[SPTAppRemoteErrorDescriptionKey] {\\\\n            // Show the error\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n### Connect and Subscribe to Player State\\\\n\\\\n1. Set your connection delegate and attempt to connect.\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    self.appRemote.delegate = self;\\\\n    [self.appRemote connect];\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n\\\\n    - (void)appRemoteDidEstablishConnection:(SPTAppRemote *)appRemote\\\\n    {\\\\n        // Connection was successful, you can begin issuing commands\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    - (void)appRemote:(SPTAppRemote *)appRemote didFailConnectionAttemptWithError:(NSError *)error\\\\n    {\\\\n        // Connection failed\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    - (void)appRemote:(SPTAppRemote *)appRemote didDisconnectWithError:(nullable NSError *)error\\\\n    {\\\\n        // Connection disconnected\\\\n    }\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n2. Set a delegate and subscribe to player state:\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    appRemote.playerAPI.delegate = self;\\\\n\\\\n    [appRemote.playerAPI subscribeToPlayerState:^(id  _Nullable result, NSError * _Nullable error) {\\\\n        // Handle Errors\\\\n    }];\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    ```objective-c\\\\n    - (void)playerStateDidChange:(id<SPTAppRemotePlayerState>)playerState\\\\n    {\\\\n        NSLog(@\"Track name: %@\", playerState.track.name);\\\\n    }\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\\\n\\\\n**Why does music need to be playing to connect with `SPTAppRemote`?**\\\\n\\\\nMusic must be playing when you connect with `SPTAppRemote` to ensure the Spotify app is not suspended in the background. iOS applications can only stay active in the background for a few seconds unless they are actively doing something like navigation or playing music.\\\\n\\\\n**Is SpotifyiOS.framework thread safe?**\\\\n\\\\nNo, the framework currently expects to be called from the main thread. It will offload most of its work to a background thread internally but callbacks to your code will also occur on the main thread.\\\\n\\\\n**What if I need to authorize without starting playback?**\\\\n\\\\nThere is an alternative authorization method. You can find more information about that [here](docs/auth.md).\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'kittinan/spotify-github-profile\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# spotify-github-profile\\\\n\\\\nCreate Spotify now playing card on your github profile\\\\n\\\\nRunning on Vercel serverless function, store data in Firebase (store only access_token, refresh_token, token_expired_timestamp)\\\\n\\\\n## Connect & Grant Permission\\\\n\\\\n- Click `Connect with Spotify` button below to grant permission\\\\n\\\\n[<img src=\"/img/btn-spotify.png\">](https://spotify-github-profile.vercel.app/api/login)\\\\n\\\\n## Example\\\\n\\\\n- Default theme\\\\n\\\\n![spotify-github-profile](/img/default.svg)\\\\n\\\\n- Compact theme\\\\n\\\\n![spotify-github-profile](/img/compact.svg)\\\\n\\\\n- Natemoo-re theme\\\\n\\\\n![spotify-github-profile](/img/natemoo-re.svg)\\\\n\\\\n- Novatorem theme\\\\n\\\\n![spotify-github-profile](/img/novatorem.svg)\\\\n\\\\n- Karaoke theme\\\\n\\\\n![spotify-github-profile](/img/karaoke.svg)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Running for development locally\\\\n\\\\nTo develop locally, you need:\\\\n\\\\n- A fork of this project as your repository\\\\n- A Vercel project connected with the forked repository\\\\n- A Firebase project with Cloud Firestore setup\\\\n- A Spotify developer account\\\\n\\\\n### Setting up Vercel\\\\n\\\\n- [Create a new Vercel project by importing](https://vercel.com/import) the forked project on GitHub\\\\n\\\\n### Setting up Firebase\\\\n\\\\n- Create [a new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)\\\\n- Create a new Cloud Firestore in the project\\\\n- Download configuration JSON file from _Project settings_ > _Service accounts_ > _Generate new private key_\\\\n- Convert private key content as BASE64\\\\n  - You can use Encode/Decode extension in VSCode to do so\\\\n  - This key will be used in step explained below\\\\n\\\\n### Setting up Spotify dev\\\\n\\\\n- Login to [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)\\\\n- Create a new project\\\\n- Edit settings to add _Redirect URIs_\\\\n  - add `http://localhost:3000/api/callback`\\\\n\\\\n### Running locally\\\\n\\\\n- Install [Vercel command line](https://vercel.com/download) with `npm i -g vercel`\\\\n- Create `.env` file at the root of the project and paste your keys in `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_SECRET_ID`, and `FIREBASE`\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nBASE_URL=\\\\\\'http://localhost:3000/api\\\\\\'\\\\nSPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=\\\\\\'____\\\\\\'\\\\nSPOTIFY_SECRET_ID=\\\\\\'____\\\\\\'\\\\nFIREBASE=\\\\\\'__BASE64_FIREBASE_JSON_FILE__\\\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- Run `vercel dev`\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n$ vercel dev\\\\nVercel CLI 20.1.2 dev (beta) — https://vercel.com/feedback\\\\n> Ready!

The goal for EZBlocker is to be the most reliable ad blocker for Spotify.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen an advertisement is playing, EZBlocker will mute Spotify until it\\'s over.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo download a pre-compiled binary of the latest version, click [here][1]. For more info, visit the [EZBlocker project page][2].\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n## Technical overview\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe current version of EZBlocker hooks Spotify in three ways: window titles, audio sessions, and a reverse listener. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Window title**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe window title is used to grab the name of the currently playing song/artist/advertisement. EZBlocker also uses the window title to grab the Spotify process handle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Audio session**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUsing lower level COM interfaces, EZBlocker is able to both find and extract information from Spotify\\'s audio session. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFirstly, if the Spotify window is hidden (in the tray), its window title cannot be used locate the correct Spotify process handle. In this case, EZBlocker falls back to searching through the audio sessions to find the correct process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSecondly, the audio session is a somewhat reliable way to detect whether or not a song/advertisement is playing regardless of whether or not the Spotify window is hidden. It can be inaccurate at times, eg. when a song has a 3 second gap of no sound, but can automatically recover.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Reverse Listener**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI\\'ve historically tried to avoid modifying the Spotify application, but since the shutdown of its unofficial local API (in mid July 2018), there was no reliable way to detect if an advertisement was playing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpotify is built with the Chromium Embedded Framework, which means many of its components are written in HTML/JS. EZBlocker patches one of them to attach a web worker that sends a signal to a local listener when an advertisement is playing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMore data could probably be extracted through the web worker, but I haven\\'t had time to explore.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n## Changelog (Major releases only):\\\\r\\\\n- V 1.8 (Oct 31, 2021):\\\\r\\\\n  - New muting logic, reduces false positives (podcasts no longer muted)\\\\r\\\\n  - Cleanup and bugfixes\\\\r\\\\n- V 1.7 (July 22, 2018):\\\\r\\\\n  - Almost a complete re-write of the application (lighter, more performant, cleaner code)\\\\r\\\\n  - New Spotify ad detection and muting logic after Spotify\\'s shutdown of its local API\\\\r\\\\n- V 1.6 (March 10, 2016):\\\\r\\\\n  - Better handling of Spotify updates/restarts\\\\r\\\\n  - Fix bugs caused by newer Spotify local API\\\\r\\\\n  - Update dependencies\\\\r\\\\n  - Now requires .NET Framework 4.5\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n## Translations\\\\r\\\\nTo better support non-English speakers, I\\'ve started an effort to translate EZBlocker.

It automatically splits songs into separate tracks and records to MP3 with media metadata, meaning you can easily start enjoying your music offline.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Spotify Recorder logs\" src=\"https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/assets/images/ui_record.png\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\n### [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)\\\\n\\\\nSpytify records what Spotify outputs, which is a longer process than downloading a Spotify playlist with a tool.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Spytify ensures that all tracks will be the official released one, all sound volume normalized and with media tags and album cover. Playlist Downloaders get mostly all tracks from YouTube which means that they can\\\\\\'t guarantee the choosen track will fit 100% the one in your playlist and they will all be the same quality.\\\\n\\\\nSpytify records the same quality that Spotify outputs ([Spotify Free 160kbps, Spotify Premium 320kbps](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/audio-quality/)), so the recorded copy will be indistinguishable from Spotify’s one.\\\\n\\\\n### [How to install it?](#how-to-install-it)\\\\n\\\\nFollow the steps shown in the F.A.Q section : [_How to install Spytify?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#install-spytify)\\\\n\\\\n### [How to use it?](#how-to-use-it)\\\\n\\\\nA standard use is to start a recording session using your favorite playlist and let it record overnight, so you avoid waiting for it to end, because Spytify does not download but records. You will then get all your songs automatically split into separate tracks without ads and with metadata.\\\\n\\\\nA recorder requires a good sound card to be able to record good quality, that\\\\\\'s why Spytify comes with a Virtual Audio Cable device, if you have issues with your sound card (volume slider and other apps sound affects the recordings, or overall recorded sound quality is worst than Spotify) you can install this virtual device using the **Speakers+** icon in Spytify settings.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t forget to hit the [F.A.Q.](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html) for tips on:\\\\n\\\\n- [_How to install Virtual Audio Cable device for better recording quality?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#install-better-audio-endpoint-device)\\\\n- [_How to isolate Spytify and Spotify on a virtual audio device to avoid background noises?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#isolate-spotify-audio-endpoint)\\\\n- [_How to reroute sound/output of a virtual audio device to my main audio device to listen to it?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#listen-to-virtual-device)\\\\n- [_How to connect to Spotify API for more accurate media tags?_](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#media-tags-not-found)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### [Features](#features)\\\\n\\\\nSplits the recorded sound into individual tracks using the artist and track names as the title, like so:\\\\n> Artist - Track.mp3\\\\n  \\\\nSaves all recordings under the same path:\\\\n> ../My Music/\\\\n  \\\\nAutomatically adds metadata from Last.fm (or [Spotify API](https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/faq.html#media-tags-not-found)) to .mp3 file:\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Recorded songs with album cover and media tags in Windows Explorer\" src=\"https://jwallet.github.io/spy-spotify/assets/images/saved_songs_list.png\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\n### [Requirements](#requirements)\\\\n\\\\nSpytify runs on Windows only.\\\\n\\\\n- Microsoft Framework ([.NET 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=49981) or higher).\\\\n- Spotify Desktop application.\\\\n\\\\nA **free Spotify account** will work, but Spotify restricts audio quality to 160 kbps.

Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) too!**\\\\n\\\\nFor authorization requests the API object requires at least to have\\\\n[your application](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications)\\\\\\'s client ID and client secret set as its properties.\\\\nWhen using the authorization code flow, the application\\\\\\'s redirect URI is required too. Those properties will then be\\\\nautomatically used by functions that depend on them.\\\\n\\\\n```Java\\\\nSpotifyApi spotifyApi = new SpotifyApi.Builder()\\\\n  .setClientId(\"<your_client_id>\")\\\\n  .setClientSecret(\"<your_client_secret>\")\\\\n  .setRedirectUri(\"<your_redirect_uri>\")\\\\n  .build();\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThere are three ways to retrieving an access token:\\\\n\\\\n#### [Client Credentials Flow](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)\\\\nUse the client credentials flow when the requests don\\\\\\'t require permission from a specific user. This flow doesn\\\\\\'t\\\\nreturn a refresh token and is useful for simple requests, like fetching albums or searching for tracks.\\\\n\\\\nExample: [ClientCredentialsExample.java](examples/authorization/client_credentials/ClientCredentialsExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n#### [Authorization Code Flow](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)\\\\nUsing the authorization code flow to retrieve an access token is necessary if the requests are bound to a specific user.\\\\nUsing this flow returns a refresh token, which can be used to renew the access token before it expires. This is how it\\\\nworks:\\\\n\\\\n1. The authorization code flow requires a code, which is part of the `redirectUri`\\\\\\'s query parameters when the user has\\\\nopened a custom URL in a browser and authorized the application.\\\\n\\\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodeUriExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/AuthorizationCodeUriExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n2. When the code has been retrieved, it can be used in another request to get an access token as well as a refresh token.\\\\n\\\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodeExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/AuthorizationCodeExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n3. Now, the refresh token in turn can be used in a loop to retrieve new access and refresh tokens.\\\\n\\\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodeRefreshExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/AuthorizationCodeRefreshExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nWhen you\\\\\\'ve fetched an access and refresh token, you have to add them to your API properties for automatic usage in\\\\nrequests. The implementer has to handle the access token\\\\\\'s expiration.\\\\n\\\\n```Java\\\\nspotifyApi\\\\n  .setAccessToken(\"<your_access_token>\")\\\\n  .setRefreshToken(\"<your_refresh_token>\")\\\\n  .build();\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### [Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)\\\\nThe authorization code flow with PKCE is quite like the Authorization Code Flow except that no client secret is necessary\\\\n(therefore, it is a good option for mobile and desktop applications). Instead, your application should generate a\\\\n**code verifier** and a **code challenge** before each authentication request.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe code verifier is a cryptographically random string between 43 and 128 characters in length. It can contain letters, digits, underscores, periods, hyphens, or tildes.\\\\nTo generate the code challenge, your app should hash the code verifier using the SHA256 algorithm. Then, base64url encode the hash that you generated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis flow provides your app with an access token which can be refreshed, too.\\\\nThe steps are similar as above:\\\\n\\\\n1. The authorization code flow with PKCE requires a code, which is part of the `redirectUri`\\\\\\'s query parameters when the user has\\\\n   opened a custom URL in a browser and authorized the application. The **code challenge** is supplied to this request as a query parameter.\\\\n\\\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodePKCEUriExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/pkce/AuthorizationCodePKCEUriExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n2. When the code has been retrieved, it can be used in another request to get an access token as well as a refresh token.\\\\n   The **code verifier** is supplied to this request a query parameter.\\\\n\\\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodePKCEExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/pkce/AuthorizationCodePKCEExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n3. Now, the refresh token in turn can be used in a loop to retrieve new access and refresh tokens.\\\\n\\\\n   Example: [AuthorizationCodePKCERefreshExample.java](examples/authorization/authorization_code/pkce/AuthorizationCodePKCERefreshExample.java)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nWhen you have fetched an access and refresh token, you have to add them to your API properties for automatic usage in\\\\nrequests. The implementer must handle the access token\\\\\\'s expiration. The refresh token can be exchanged for an\\\\naccess token only once, after which it becomes invalid.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Examples\\\\n- **Albums**\\\\n  - [Get an Album](examples/data/albums/GetAlbumExample.java)\\\\n  -

You\\\\ncan find details about specific parts or single classes in the sections below.\\\\n\\\\n#### Enumerations\\\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/enums/`\\\\n\\\\nEnumerations allow elements to \"be of a type\" and limit them to a known value set. They are currently not specified in a\\\\nunique place, but are rather scrambled across the online reference. Thus, the reference only allows for construction\\\\nof enum classes from this sparse information.\\\\n\\\\n#### Exceptions\\\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/exceptions/`\\\\n\\\\nExceptions are thrown when errors occur. They are following RFC-specified\\\\n[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) and are packed with a more detailed error\\\\ndescription.\\\\n\\\\n#### Model Objects\\\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/model_objects/`\\\\n\\\\nThe model objects are entities that form the API\\\\\\'s responses in arranged formats. They are mostly specified in the\\\\n[Web API Object Model](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/) and in the\\\\n[Web API Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/). Though, unreferenced model\\\\nobjects exist. This project subdivides those into...\\\\n\\\\n- \"miscellaneous\" model objects: these are mentioned somewhere in the reference, but not in the model object list\\\\n- \"special\" model objects: these are not mentioned at all, but appear in API answers nonetheless.\\\\n\\\\nJava classes representing those model objects include private instance variables, a private constructor, but public getter\\\\nmethods as well as an embedded...\\\\n\\\\n1. builder class, including the setter functions and a public build method\\\\n2. JSON-util class, implementing the `createModelObject` method.\\\\n\\\\n#### Requests\\\\n`src/main/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/requests/`\\\\n\\\\nThe request classes mirror the strucure of Spotify\\\\\\'s Web Api endpoints. They are divided into several categories like\\\\n`authorization`, `data/albums` or `data/tracks`. They must extend from `AbstractDataRequest` and contain an\\\\nimplementation of the request\\\\\\'s `execute` method. They have to embed a builder class too, enabling dynamic request\\\\ncreation.\\\\n\\\\n#### Tests\\\\n`src/test/java/se.michaelthelin.spotify/`\\\\n\\\\nUnit tests ensure that implemented features work. This project\\\\\\'s unit tests are implemented with [JUnit](http://junit.org/)\\\\nand [mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) for mocking.\\\\n\\\\n##### Fixtures\\\\n`src/test/fixtures/`\\\\n\\\\nFixtures are JSON files that represent the data returned from the API server. We use the examples directly provided by\\\\nthe [Web API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) with minor tweaks. Tweaks\\\\nare needed because the reference sometimes contains invalid data examples.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'fouady/SpotifyTray-Android\\', \\'language\\': \\'Java\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"SpotifyTray-Android\\\\n===================\\\\nThis Android project provides simplistic code to produce a floating widget like Facebook\\'s chatheads app. It is supported by Android 2.3.3+ (API 10+).\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that it does not provide or include any Spotify music streaming features and is essentially just the UI for demonstration purposes only. Also note that this is not a project developed/endorsed by Spotify.\\\\n\\\\n## Features\\\\nAssume that it\\'s a small muted music player without any audio.\\\\n- Tray can be dragged around the screen.\\\\n- Tray, when released, comes back to a specific region on y-axis.\\\\n- The tray can be tapped to open/close.\\\\n- The widgets on the tray animate when the tray is between close and open states.\\\\n- Next and previous music buttons change the current song and hence the album cover changes too. The change is animated.\\\\n- Play and pause buttons work, but the change is not obvious since there is no audio.\\\\n- Each song has a duration. After the song has played for that duration, it switches to next song which is evident from the animated change that occurs when next button is pressed. You will notice this if you stay on the first song for 30s.\\\\n- The widget can be shut down from notification menu.\\\\n\\\\n## Demo\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxdTkdNkVs\\\\n\\\\n## License\\\\nMIT License.

On this second version of the manager app, we added a couple of features such as the ability to uninstall, open the app\\\\\\'s settings directly, clear the offline cached datas and launch the app. We hope that all users find these newly added features very useful.\\\\n\\\\n# Legacy Databases Officially Shutdown (04/01/22)  \\\\nLegacy databases are now officially shutdown. Update to the latest version of xManager (v3.2) to continue using the app.  \\\\n\\\\n**More Info:**  \\\\n> These are the databases used by \"xSpotify Manager\" up until xManager v1-v3.1. Those databases are very old and deprecated at the same time. That is why we decided to take them down.  \\\\n\\\\n# FOR CONTRIBUTORS (01/18/22)  \\\\n**CODE CHANGE:** Pull request should be done on the **\"Developer\"** branch.  \\\\n\\\\n**TRANSLATION CHANGE/UPDATE:** Pull request should be done on the **\"Developer\"** branch.

It is compatible with iOS 9 or later. \\\\n\\\\n### Pre-requisites\\\\nYou will need to register your app in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).\\\\n\\\\nMake sure to use a unique redirect url and to supply the bundle ID from your app.\\\\n\\\\nAfter registering, you will receive a client ID and a client secret.\\\\n\\\\n### Set up SpotifyLogin\\\\n\\\\nSet up SpotifyLogin using any of the methods detailed below (Cocoapods / Carthage / manually).\\\\n\\\\n### Set up info.plist\\\\n\\\\nIn Xcode, go to your app\\\\\\'s target and select the **Info** tab. At the bottom, of the screen you will find **URL Types**, expand the list and create a new one.\\\\n\\\\n![Set up info.plist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889949/28974992-b30ea08a-7938-11e7-9de5-b00656a42256.png)\\\\n\\\\nAdd the app\\\\\\'s identifer as the **Identifier** and the redirect url scheme in **URL schemes**.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you will need to add \"spotify-action\" to the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes key:\\\\n![LSApplicationQueriesSchemes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889949/29968001-f020c4d4-8f19-11e7-8925-433d3b30f842.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Set up your AppDelegate\\\\n\\\\nAdd the following to your app delegate:\\\\n\\\\n```swift\\\\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\\\\n    SpotifyLogin.shared.configure(clientID: <#T##String#>, clientSecret: <#T##String#>, redirectURL: <#T##URL#>)\\\\n    return true\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\\\\n    let handled = SpotifyLogin.shared.applicationOpenURL(url) { (error) in }\\\\n    return handled\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Check if a user is logged in.\\\\n\\\\nYou can retrieve an access token and check if a user is logged in by:\\\\n\\\\n```swift\\\\nSpotifyLogin.shared.getAccessToken { (accessToken, error) in\\\\n    if error != nil {\\\\n        // User is not logged in, show log in flow.\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis also automatically takes care of renewing expired tokens. \\\\n\\\\n### Log in / Log out\\\\n\\\\nTo add the default log in button:\\\\n```swift\\\\nlet button = SpotifyLoginButton(viewController: self, scopes: [.streaming, .userLibraryRead])\\\\nself.view.addSubview(button)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe scopes define the set of permissions your app will be able to use.

For example, if the application doesn\\\\\\'t need to play music but needs user login or Web API capabilities with other [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/) you can use the `Spotify Authentication Library` by itself.\\\\n\\\\nHead over to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/) for more reading about the Android SDK.\\\\n\\\\n### Spotify App Remote\\\\n\\\\nThis library contains classes for music playback control and metadata access.\\\\nThe built-in authentication in App Remote requests for `app-control-scope` only, and is the only scope needed to use App Remote. No token exchange.

Brought to you by the lovely people at [Benchmark](http://benchmark.co.uk).\\\\n\\\\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\\\\n\\\\nSimply create a Slash Command, such as `/jukebox`, which accepts a track name (also the artist too for a less fuzzy search) to add to a pre-defined Spotify playlist:\\\\n\\\\n    /jukebox Bell Biv DeVoe – Poison\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\n### Slack\\\\n\\\\nThere are two ways to use slackbox - via a Slash Commands or an Outgoing Webhook:\\\\n\\\\n#### Slash Command\\\\n\\\\nSlash commands allow for private functions within Slack which will **not** show up in chat history.\\\\n\\\\nFirst you\\\\\\'ll want to create your Slack Slash Command, which you can do by going to your [Slash Commands page](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands).\\\\n\\\\n#### Outgoing WebHook\\\\n\\\\nOutgoing webhooks allow data to be exported from Slack channels. Using an outgoing webhook means song additions will be public so users will know when songs are requested and who requested them.\\\\n\\\\nFirst you\\\\\\'ll want to create your Outgoing Webhook, which you can do by going to your [Outgoing WebHooks page](https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook).\\\\n\\\\nOutgoing WebHooks work best with a trigger word. This way only messages with the trigger word (or words) will be parsed and added.\\\\n\\\\n**NOTE:** You may only use slash commands _or_ outgoing webhooks. The Slack Token environment variable can only be set once so it needs to be the token from this or the slash command.\\\\n\\\\n#### Common\\\\n\\\\nDuring setup, have your slash command or outgoing webhook submit a POST to your app\\\\\\'s `/store` endpoint, e.g. `https://app-name.herokuapp.com/store`.\\\\n\\\\nMake a note of the `token` (either from the slash command or outgoing webhook), as you\\\\\\'ll need it later to help guard against cross-site request forgery.\\\\n\\\\n### Spotify\\\\n\\\\nHead over to [Spotify\\\\\\'s Developer Site](http://developer.spotify.com) and create a new Application. Make sure you add whatever slackbox\\\\\\'s callback URI as a valid callback URI. If you\\\\\\'re running locally, this will be `http://localhost:5000/callback` or on Heroku `https://app-name.herokuapp.com/callback`\\\\n\\\\nMake a note of the `key`, `secret` and `callback URI` too, as you\\\\\\'ll need these later as well.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, don\\\\\\'t forget to make a playlist. If you do this through [Spotify\\\\\\'s web interface](http://play.spotify.com) then the `playlist identifier` will be the last segment of the URI - make a note of this too! If there\\\\\\'s a better way of finding this out, we\\\\\\'re all ears. If you do this through the app, right-click the playlist to get it\\\\\\'s web URL and again, you need the last segment of the URI.\\\\n\\\\n### Environment variables\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\\\\\'ve cloned slackbox or hit the \"Deploy with Heroku\" button you\\\\\\'ll need to setup the following environment variables. These can either be stored in a `.env` or set up as config variables in Heroku.\\\\n\\\\n* `SLACK_TOKEN` - The token from Slack\\\\\\'s Slash Command.\\\\n* `SLACK_OUTGOING` - True if using [Slack Outgoing WebHooks](https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook), false if using [Slack Slash Commands](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands)\\\\n* `SPOTIFY_KEY` - Your Spotify application key (a.k.a Client ID).\\\\n* `SPOTIFY_SECRET` - Your Spotify application secret (a.k.a Client Secret).\\\\n* `SPOTIFY_USERNAME` - Your Spotify username.\\\\n* `SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID` - Your playlist identifier.\\\\n* `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` - URI to redirect to once your user has allowed the application\\\\\\'s permissions.\\\\n\\\\n### Authentication\\\\n\\\\nVisit your slackbox\\\\\\'s home page to authenticate yourself with Spotify and you should be all set!\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php\\', \\'language\\': \\'PHP\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"# Spotify Web API PHP\\\\n\\\\n[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php)\\\\n![build](https://github.com/jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php/workflows/build/badge.svg)\\\\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/r/jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php?branch=main)\\\\n\\\\nThis is a PHP wrapper for [Spotify\\'s Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).

\\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"spotify-backup\\\\n==============\\\\n\\\\nA Python script that exports all of your Spotify playlists, useful for paranoid Spotify users like me, afraid that one day Spotify will go under and take all of our playlists with it!\\\\n\\\\nTo run the script, [save it from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caseychu/spotify-backup/master/spotify-backup.py) and double-click it. It\\'ll ask you for a filename and then pop open a web page so you can authorize access to the Spotify API. Then the script will load your playlists and save a tab-separated file with your playlists that you can open in Excel. You can even copy-paste the rows from Excel into a Spotify playlist.\\\\n\\\\nYou can run the script from the command line:\\\\n\\\\n    python spotify-backup.py playlists.txt\\\\n\\\\nor, to get a JSON dump, use:\\\\n\\\\n    python spotify-backup.py playlists.json --format=json\\\\n\\\\nBy default, it includes your playlists. To include your Liked Songs, you can use:\\\\n\\\\n    python spotify-backup.py playlists.txt --dump=liked,playlists\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf for some reason the browser-based authorization flow doesn\\'t work, you can also [generate an OAuth token](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-playlists/) on the developer site (with the `playlist-read-private` permission) and pass it with the `--token` option.\\\\n\\\\nCollaborative playlists and playlist folders don\\'t show up in the API, sadly.\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'hnarayanan/shpotify\\', \\'language\\': \\'Shell\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# shpotify\\\\n\\\\n*shpotify* is a simple Bash/Apple script to control\\\\n [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) from the command line on a Mac.\\\\n\\\\nIf you find this interesting, you should [follow me on\\\\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/copingbear) to learn about the other\\\\nthings I do.\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\n[Download and install](http://www.spotify.com/download) the Spotify\\\\ndesktop application if you haven’t already.\\\\n\\\\n### With Homebrew\\\\n\\\\nThe easiest way to install shpotify is by using the [Homebrew package\\\\nmanager](http://brew.sh):\\\\n\\\\n````\\\\nbrew install shpotify\\\\n````\\\\n\\\\n### Manual installation\\\\n\\\\nIf you don’t use Homebrew, you can install the script manually by\\\\nfollowing a few simple steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Fetch a copy of this repository, either with git or [download the\\\\n   zip archive](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/archive/master.zip).\\\\n\\\\n2. Navigate to the folder where you fetched the repository (unzip if\\\\n   needed) and make sure the file called `spotify` is executable:\\\\n   ````\\\\n   cd shpotify\\\\n   chmod +x spotify\\\\n   ````\\\\n\\\\n3. Copy the file `spotify` to a convenient location in your `PATH`, or\\\\n   set your `PATH` to include the folder where the file is located.\\\\n\\\\n### Connecting to Spotify’s API\\\\n\\\\nshpotify needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by\\\\nname.

Export the Spotify songs to an CSV File\\\\nThe first step is getting the songs you want to import into Apple Music into a CSV file. The simplest way to do this is using [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html).  \\\\nIf you want to export you whole Spotify library, simply create a new playlist called *All* and drag your whole library into it using the Spotify desktop app. You can then export the playlist *All* using *Exportify*. Save the resulting file as *spotify.csv* in the same directory as the directory you cloned this repo into.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Match the Spotify songs with their Apple Music identifier\\\\nIn order to add songs to our Apple Music library, we need their Apple Music identifier. Running `python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` will use the *spotify.csv* file to create a new file *itunes.csv* with each line consisting of the Apple Music identifier of a song in your Spotify library.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Use an intercepting proxy to retrieve the Apple Music request headers\\\\nStart iTunes and [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com) (or another intercepting proxy you like). Make sure SSL Proxying is enabled and working correctly. Next, select a random song on Apple Music you don\\'t have in your library yet, right click and choose \\'Add to library\\'. If everything went well, you\\'re now able to view all the request headers in Charles of a request to `https://ld-4.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZDaap.woa/daap/databases/1/cloud-add`. We\\'re only interested in `Cookie`, `X-Dsid` and `X-Guid`. Copy the value of these header and paste them in the appropriate place  in `insert-songs.py` (line 29 and further).  \\\\nNext, run `python3 insert-songs.py` and go grab a coffee. You\\'re songs are now being imported into Apple Music.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Current issues\\\\n\\\\n### API limit rate\\\\nApple Music doesn\\'t like it when we\\'re adding a lot of songs in a small amount of time. If we do so, the API responds to all further request with `403 Too many requests`. After this, you\\'re blocked from the API for an undetermined amount of time. We\\'re currently trying to avoid this by waiting after each request. A delay of 30 seconds seems fine to import large libraries into Apple Music. If you\\'re library is smaller, feel free to decrease the delay in `inserts-songs.py`.\\\\n\\\\n### Missing songs\\\\nThe script I\\'m using to retrieve the Apple Music identifier for a Spotify song is quite basic. It simply compares the title and artist to find out if a Spotify and Apple Music song match. Some songs don\\'t have the exact same title (extraneous spacing for example) in both services. This results in the script failing to retrieve an identifier for some songs.\\\\n\\\\n### Terminal encoding\\\\nSome users are reporting errors like `UnicodeEncodeError: \\'ascii\\' codec can\\'t encode character \\'\\\\\\\\xd8\\' in ...` when running the scripts. The problem here is that Python is trying to convert UTF-8 characters to ASCII to print them to standard output. This can be solved by setting the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to `utf-8`.  \\\\nIn Bash, simply call the scripts like this: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 insert-songs.Py`\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'spotify/web-api\\', \\'language\\': \\'RAML\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"We\\'ve moved!

Though, for making apps with Spotify playback capabilities, on any other platform than Android and iOS, there is currently no alternative to libspotify.*\\\\n\\\\n*libspotify has been the main way of integrating with Spotify since 2009, and is today a part of numerous open source projects and commercial applications, including many receivers and even cars. There’s no guarantees, but one can hope that the large deployment of libspotify means that the library will continue to work with the Spotify service for a long time into the future.*\\\\n\\\\nFeatures\\\\n--------\\\\n\\\\n-  real-time VBR or CBR ripping from Spotify PCM stream\\\\n\\\\n-  writes ID3v2/metadata tags (including album covers)\\\\n\\\\n-  rips files into the following directory structure: ``artist/album/artist - song.mp3`` by default or optionally into a user-specified structure (see `Format String`_ section below)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to skip or overwrite existing files\\\\n\\\\n-  accepts tracks, playlists, albums, and artist URIs\\\\n\\\\n-  search for tracks using Spotify queries\\\\n\\\\n-  options for interactive login (no password in shell history) and\\\\n   to relogin using previous credentials\\\\n\\\\n-  option to remove tracks from playlist after successful ripping\\\\n\\\\n-  globally installs ripper script using setup.py\\\\n\\\\n-  Python 2.7.x and 3.4.x compatible.  Python 3 will occasionally throw a ``NameError: name \\\\\\'_lock\\\\\\' is not defined`` exception at the end of the script due to an `upstream bug <https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify/issues/133>`__ in ``pyspotify``.\\\\n\\\\n-  use a config file to specify common command-line options\\\\n\\\\n-  helpful progress bar to gauge the time remaining until completion\\\\n\\\\n-  keep local files in sync with a Spotify playlist, m3u and wpl playlist file\\\\n\\\\n-  option to rip to ALAC, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``avconv`` dependency)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to rip to FLAC, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``flac`` dependency)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to rip to Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3 (requires extra ``vorbis-tools`` dependency)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to rip to Opus instead of MP3 (requires extra ``opus-tools`` dependency)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to rip to AAC instead of MP3 (requires extra ``faac`` dependency)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to rip to MP4/M4A instead of MP3 (requires compiling ``fdkaac``)\\\\n\\\\n-  option to replace output filenames\\\\n\\\\n-  option to normalize output filenames to NFKD (see http://unicode.org/faq/normalization.html)\\\\n\\\\n**Please note: Spotify’s highest quality setting is 320 kbps, so the benefit of ripping to a lossless format is to not double encode the audio data.

Otherwise, use your Spotify login/password.\\\\n\\\\nConfig File\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\nFor options that you want set on every run, you can use a config file named ``config.ini`` in the settings folder (defaults to ``~/.spotify-ripper``).  The options in the config file use the same name as the command line options with the exception that dashes are translated to ``snake_case``.  Any option specified in the command line will overwrite any setting in the config file.  Please put all options under a ``[main]`` section.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example config file\\\\n\\\\n.. code:: ini\\\\n\\\\n    [main]\\\\n    ascii = True\\\\n    format = {album_artist}/{album}/{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}\\\\n    quality = 160\\\\n    vorbis = True\\\\n    last = True\\\\n\\\\nFormat String\\\\n-------------\\\\n\\\\nThe format string dictates how ``spotify-ripper`` will organize your ripped files.  This is controlled through the ``-f | --format`` option.  The string should include the format of the file name and optionally a directory structure.   If you do not include a format string, the default format will be used: ``{album_artist}/{album}/{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``.\\\\n\\\\nThe ``--flat`` option is shorthand for using the format string: ``{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``, and the ``--flat-with-index`` option is shorthand for using the format string: ``{idx:3} - {artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``.  The use of these shorthand options will override any ``--format`` string option given.\\\\n\\\\nYour format string can include the following variables names, which are case-sensitive and wrapped in curly braces, if you want your file/path name to be overwritten with Spotify metadata.\\\\n\\\\nFormat String Variables\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\\\\n| Names and Aliases                       | Description                                   |\\\\n+=========================================+===============================================+\\\\n| ``{track_artist}``, ``{artist}``        | The track\\\\\\'s artist                            |\\\\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\\\\n| ``{track_artists}``, ``{artists}``      | Similar to ``{track_artist}`` but will be join|\\\\n|                                         | multiple artists with a comma                 |\\\\n|                                         | (e.g. \"artist 1, artist 2\")                   |\\\\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\\\\n| ``{album_artist}``                      | When passing an album, the album\\\\\\'s artist     |\\\\n|                                         | (e.g. \"Various Artists\").

For example, ``{idx:3}`` will produce the following output: 001, 002, 003, etc.  If no number is provided, no zero-filled padding will occur (e.g. 8, 9, 10, 11, ...). The variables that accept this option include ``{idx}``, ``{track_num}``, ``{disc_num}``, ``{smart_track_num}`` and their aliases.\\\\n\\\\nPrefix String\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\nFormat variable ``feat_artists`` takes a prefix string to be prepended before the output.  For example, ``{feat_artists:featuring} will produce the follow output ``featuing Bruno Mars``.  If there are no featuring artists, the prefix string (and any preceding spaces) will not be included.\\\\n\\\\nPlaylist Sync Option\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\nBy default, other than checking for an overwrite, ``spotify-ripper`` will not keep track of local files once they are ripped from Spotify.  However, if you use the ``--playlist-sync`` option when passing a playlist URI, ``spotify-ripper`` will store a json file in your settings directory that keeps track of location of your ripped files for that playlist.\\\\n\\\\nIf at a later time, the playlist is changed on Spotify (i.e. songs reordered, removed or added), ``spotify-ripper`` will try to keep your local files \"in sync\" the playlist if you rerun the same command.  For example, if your format string is ``{index} {artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``, it will rename is existing files so the index is correct.  Note that with option set, ``spotify-ripper`` will delete a song that was previously on the playlist, but was removed but still exists on your local machine.  It does not affect files outside of the playlist and has no effect on non-playlist URIs.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to redownload a playlist (for example with improved quality), you either need to remove the song files from your local or use the ``--overwrite`` option.\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nPrerequisites\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\n-  `libspotify <https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  `pyspotify <https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  a Spotify binary `app\\\\n   key <https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/>`__\\\\n   (spotify\\\\\\\\_appkey.key)\\\\n\\\\n-  `lame <http://lame.sourceforge.net>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  `mutagen <https://mutagen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  `colorama <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  (optional) `flac <https://xiph.org/flac/index.html>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  (optional) `opus-tools <http://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  (optional) `vorbis-tools <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  (optional) `faac <http://www.audiocoding.com/downloads.html>`__\\\\n\\\\n-  (optional) `fdkaac <https://github.com/nu774/fdkaac>`__\\\\n\\\\nMac OS X\\\\n~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\nRecommend approach uses `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ and\\\\n`pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__\\\\n\\\\nTo install pyenv using homebrew:\\\\n\\\\n.. code:: bash\\\\n\\\\n    $ brew update\\\\n    $ brew install pyenv\\\\n    $ eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\\\\n    ## the next line ensures \\\\\\'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\\\\\\' is run everytime terminal is opened\\\\n    $ echo \\\\\\'if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"; fi\\\\\\' >> ~/.bash_profile\\\\n    $ pyenv install 2.7.10  # or whatever version of python you want\\\\n    $ pyenv global 2.7.10\\\\n    $ python -V             # should say Python 2.7.10\\\\n\\\\nTo install spotify-ripper once pyenv is setup:\\\\n\\\\n.. code:: bash\\\\n\\\\n    $ brew install homebrew/binary/libspotify\\\\n    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify.12.1.51.dylib \\\\\\\\\\\\n        /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify\\\\n    $ brew install lame\\\\n    $ git clone https://github.com/hbashton/spotify-ripper.git && cd spotify-ripper && sudo python setup.py install\\\\n    $ pyenv rehash\\\\n\\\\n**Note that Spotify may no longer be issuing developer keys.** See `Libspotify’s Deprecation`_\\\\n\\\\nDownload an application key file ``spotify_appkey.key`` from\\\\n``https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/`` (requires a Spotify\\\\nPremium Account) and move the file to the ``~/.spotify-ripper`` directory (or use\\\\nthe ``-k | --key`` option).\\\\n\\\\nUbuntu/Debian\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\nRecommend approach uses `pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kaaes/spotify-web-api-android.git`\\\\n2. Build: `./gradlew assemble`\\\\n3. Grab the `aar` that can be found in `spotify-api/build/outputs/aar/spotify-web-api-android-0.4.1.aar`\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\nOut of the box it uses [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) HTTP client and a [single thread executor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html).\\\\n\\\\n```java\\\\nSpotifyApi api = new SpotifyApi();\\\\n\\\\n// Most (but not all) of the Spotify Web API endpoints require authorisation.\\\\n// If you know you\\\\\\'ll only use the ones that don\\\\\\'t require authorisation you can skip this step\\\\napi.setAccessToken(\"myAccessToken\");\\\\n\\\\nSpotifyService spotify = api.getService();\\\\n\\\\nspotify.getAlbum(\"2dIGnmEIy1WZIcZCFSj6i8\", new Callback<Album>() {\\\\n    @Override\\\\n    public void success(Album album, Response response) {\\\\n        Log.d(\"Album success\", album.name);\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    @Override\\\\n    public void failure(RetrofitError error) {\\\\n        Log.d(\"Album failure\", error.toString());\\\\n    }\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt is also possible to construct the adapter with custom parameters.\\\\n\\\\n```java\\\\nfinal String accessToken = \"myAccessToken\";\\\\n\\\\nRestAdapter restAdapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()\\\\n        .setEndpoint(SpotifyApi.SPOTIFY_WEB_API_ENDPOINT)\\\\n        .setRequestInterceptor(new RequestInterceptor() {\\\\n            @Override\\\\n            public void intercept(RequestFacade request) {\\\\n                request.addHeader(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \" + accessToken);\\\\n            }\\\\n        })\\\\n        .build();\\\\n\\\\nSpotifyService spotify = restAdapter.create(SpotifyService.class);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Obtaining Access Tokens\\\\n\\\\nThe most straightforward way to get the access token is to use the Authentication Library from the [Spotify Android SDK](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk).\\\\nDetailed information how to use it can be found in the [Spotify Android SDK Authentication Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/android-sdk-authentication-guide/).\\\\n\\\\nFeeling adventurous? You can implement the auth flow yourself, following the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\n\\\\nWhen using Retrofit, errors are returned as [`RetrofitError`](http://square.github.io/retrofit/javadoc/retrofit/RetrofitError.html)\\\\nobjects. These objects, among others, contain HTTP status codes and their descriptions,\\\\nfor example `400 - Bad Request`.\\\\nIn many cases this will work well enough but in some cases Spotify Web API returns more detailed information,\\\\nfor example `400 - No search query`.\\\\n\\\\nTo use the data returned in the response from the Web API `SpotifyCallback` object should be passed to the\\\\nrequest method instead of regular Retrofit\\\\\\'s `Callback`:\\\\n```java\\\\nspotify.getMySavedTracks(new SpotifyCallback<Pager<SavedTrack>>() {\\\\n    @Override\\\\n    public void success(Pager<SavedTrack> savedTrackPager, Response response) {\\\\n        // handle successful response\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    @Override\\\\n    public void failure(SpotifyError error) {\\\\n        // handle error\\\\n    }\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\nFor synchronous requests `RetrofitError` can be converted to `SpotifyError` if needed:\\\\n```java\\\\ntry {\\\\n    Pager<SavedTrack> mySavedTracks = spotify.getMySavedTracks();\\\\n} catch (RetrofitError error) {\\\\n    SpotifyError spotifyError = SpotifyError.fromRetrofitError(error);\\\\n    // handle error\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Help\\\\n\\\\n#### Versioning policy\\\\nWe use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) as our versioning policy.\\\\n\\\\n#### Bugs, Feature requests\\\\nFound a bug?

However, to use this library to its full extent\\\\nyou will need to learn how to use the Ruby FFI API.\\\\n\\\\nThe Spotify gem has:\\\\n\\\\n- [100% API coverage][], including callback support. You’ll be able to use any function from the libspotify library.\\\\n- [Automatic garbage collection][]. Piggybacking on Ruby’s GC to manage pointer lifecycle.\\\\n- [Parallell function call protection][]. libspotify is not thread-safe, but Spotify protects you by making all API calls in a specific background thread.\\\\n- [Type conversion and type safety][]. Special pointers for every Spotify type, protecting you from accidental mix-ups.\\\\n- [Support for Ruby, JRuby and Rubinius][]. Thanks to FFI, the gem runs fine on the main three Ruby implementations!\\\\n\\\\n[100% API coverage]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API\\\\n[Automatic garbage collection]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/ManagedPointer\\\\n[Parallell function call protection]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify#method_missing-class_method\\\\n[Type conversion and type safety]: http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/ManagedPointer\\\\n[Support for Ruby, JRuby and Rubinius]: https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/blob/master/.travis.yml\\\\n\\\\nContact details\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\n- __Got questions?__ Ask on the mailing list: [ruby-spotify@googlegroups.com][] (<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ruby-spotify>)\\\\n- __Found a bug?__ Report an issue: <https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/issues/new>\\\\n- __Have feedback?__ I ❤ feedback! Please send it to the mailing list.\\\\n\\\\nQuestions, notes and answers\\\\n----------------------------\\\\n\\\\n### Links to keep close at hand when using libspotify\\\\n\\\\n- [spotify gem API reference](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API) — YARDoc reference for the spotify gem, maps to the [libspotify function list](https://developer.spotify.com/docs/libspotify/12.1.51/api_8h.html).\\\\n- [libspotify C API reference](https://developer.spotify.com/docs/libspotify/12.1.51/) — the one true source of documentation.\\\\n- [libspotify FAQ](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/faq/) — you should read this at least once.\\\\n- [spotify gem examples](https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/tree/master/examples) — located in the spotify gem repository.\\\\n- [spotify gem FAQ](#questions-notes-and-answers) — this README section.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### How to run the examples\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll need:\\\\n\\\\n1. Your [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) premium account credentials. If you sign in with Facebook, you’ll need your Facebook account e-mail and password.\\\\n2. Your [Spotify application key](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/keys/). Download the binary key, and put it in the `examples/` directory.\\\\n\\\\nRunning the examples is as simple as:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nruby example-audio_stream.rb\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAvailable examples are:\\\\n\\\\n- **example-audio_stream.rb**: plays songs from Spotify with the [plaything](https://github.com/Burgestrand/plaything) gem, using OpenAL.\\\\n- **example-console.rb**: logs in to Spotfify, and initiates a pry session to allow experimentation with the spotify gem API.\\\\n- **example-listing_playlists.rb**: list all playlists available for a certain user.\\\\n- **example-loading_object.rb**: loads a track using polling and the spotify gem API.\\\\n- **example-random_related_artists.rb**: looks up an artist and its similar artists on spotify, then it picks a similar artist at random and does the same to that artist, over and over. I have used this example file to test prolonged usage of the API.\\\\n\\\\n### Creating a Session, the first thing you should do\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all functions require you to have created a session before calling them. Forgetting to do so won’t work at best, and will segfault at worst. You\\\\\\'ll also want to log in before doing things as well, or objects will never load.\\\\n\\\\nSee [Spotify::API#session_create](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_create-instance_method) for how to create a session.\\\\nSee [Spotify::API#session_login](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_login-instance_method) for logging in.\\\\n\\\\n### libspotify is an asynchronous library\\\\n\\\\nWhen creating objects in libspotify they are not populated with data instantly, instead libspotify schedules them for download from the Spotify backend. For libspotify to do it\\\\\\'s work with downloading content, you need to call [Spotify::API#session_process_events](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_process_events-instance_method) regularly.\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook vs Spotify Classic\\\\n\\\\nUsers who signed up to Spotify with their Facebook account will have numeric IDs as usernames, so a link to their profile looks like [spotify:user:11101648092](spotify:user:11101648092). Spotify Classic users instead have their usernames as canonical name, so a link to their profile looks like [spotify:user:burgestrand](spotify:user:burgestrand).\\\\n\\\\nThis matters, for example, when you use the function [Spotify::API#session_publishedcontainer_for_user_create](http://rdoc.info/github/Burgestrand/spotify/master/Spotify/API#session_publishedcontainer_for_user_create-instance_method).\\\\n\\\\n### Callbacks can be dangerous\\\\n\\\\nlibspotify allows you to pass callbacks that will be invoked by libspotify when events of interest occur, such as being logged out, or receiving audio data when playing a track.\\\\n\\\\nCallbacks can be very tricky. They must never be garbage collected while they are in use by libspotify, or you may get very weird bugs with your Ruby interpreter randomly crashing. Do use them, but be careful.\\\\n\\\\n### Opinions and the Spotify gem\\\\n\\\\nThe Spotify gem has very few opinions. It is build to closely resemble the libspotify C API, and has very little\\\\nto aid you in terms of how to structure your application. It aims to make calling the libspotify C API frictionless,\\\\nbut not much more. It is up to you to decide your own path.\\\\n\\\\n### A note about gem versioning\\\\n\\\\nGiven a version `X.Y.Z`, each segment corresponds to:\\\\n\\\\n- `X` reflects supported libspotify version (12.1.45 => 12). There are __no guarantees__ of backwards-compatibility!\\\\n- `Y` is for backwards-**incompatible** changes.\\\\n- `Z` is for backwards-**compatible** changes.\\\\n\\\\nYou should use the following version constraint: `gem \"spotify\", \"~> 12.5.3\"`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Manually installing libspotify\\\\n\\\\nBy default, Spotify uses [the libspotify gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/libspotify) which means you do\\\\nnot need to install libspotify yourself. However, if your platform is not supported by the libspotify\\\\ngem you will need to install libspotify yourself.\\\\n\\\\nPlease note, that if your platform is not supported by the libspotify gem I’d very much appreciate it\\\\nif you could create an issue on [libspotify gem issue tracker](https://github.com/Burgestrand/libspotify/issues)\\\\nso I can fix the build for your platform.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions on installing libspotify manually are in the wiki: [How to install libspotify](https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/wiki)\\\\n\\\\n[semantic versioning (semver.org)]:

Spotify Desktop client. \\\\n\\\\nNote that some of the functionalities are only available on macOS systems (see [How it works section](#how-it-works))\\\\n\\\\n**This extension requires Spotify Premium to work on Windows**\\\\n\\\\n## How it works\\\\n\\\\n* On macOS, this extension uses [spotify-node-applescript](https://github.com/andrehaveman/spotify-node-applescript) (basically a wrapper for the official Spotify AppleScript API) to communicate with Spotify.\\\\n* On Windows, the extension uses the Spotify Web API. \\\\n* On Linux, it uses a combination of dbus and pactl.\\\\n\\\\nSpotify Web API implementation can be used on any platform, but it does have some drawbacks:\\\\n* It doesn\\\\\\'t work without internet connection (Linux and OS X implementations do).\\\\n* Full functionality is only available to Spotify Premium users. \\\\n* API calls are rate limited.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time it provides tighter integration and it\\\\\\'s more or less future proofed.\\\\n\\\\n## Features\\\\n* Shows the currently playing song in the vscode status bar.\\\\n![status bar](media/screenshot.png)\\\\n* Provides [commands](#commands) for controlling

Find them by searching for \"Spotify\" in the command pallette:\\\\n\\\\n![Commands](media/screenshot2.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Adding or changing hotkeys\\\\nAll keyboard shortcuts in vscode can be customized via the `User/keybindings.json` file.\\\\n\\\\nTo configure keyboard shortcuts the way you want, go to the menu under File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts.\\\\nThis will open the Default Keyboard Shortcuts on the left and your `User/keybindings.json` file where you can overwrite the default bindings on the right. You may also see an interface to modify the shortcuts on different versions of vscode.\\\\n\\\\nExample :\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\"command\": \"spotify.volumeDown\",\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\"key\": \"cmd+shift+g\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor more info on hotkeys please look at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings\\\\n\\\\n## Buttons\\\\nThis extension provides a variety of buttons to control Spotify from status bar. By default 4 buttons are enabled:\\\\n1. Previous track\\\\n2. Play / Pause\\\\n3. Next track\\\\n4. Mute / Unmute\\\\n\\\\nYou can modify the shown buttons by changing your parameters ([go here to find out how](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userandworkspace)):\\\\n```json\\\\n\"spotify.showNextButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": true,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show next button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showPreviousButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": true,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show previous button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showPlayButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show play button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showPauseButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show pause button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showPlayPauseButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": true,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show play|pause button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showMuteVolumeButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show mute button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showUnmuteVolumeButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show unmute button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showMuteUnmuteVolumeButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": true,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show mute|unmute button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showVolumeUpButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show volume up button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showVolumeDownButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show volume down button.\"\\\\n}\\\\n\"spotify.showToggleRepeatingButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show toggle repeating button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.showToggleShufflingButton\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"boolean\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": false,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Whether to show toggle shuffling button.\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor the full configuration options go [here](https://github.com/ShyykoSerhiy/vscode-spotify/blob/master/package.json#L161).\\\\n\\\\nNote that due to limitations of Spotify\\\\\\'s Applescript API ```toggleRepeatingButton``` toggles only\\\\n\\\\\\'repeat all\\\\\\' property of spotify. There is no way to set \\\\\\'repeat one\\\\\\' via vscode-spotify.  \\\\n\\\\nYou can also change the position of buttons by changing the parameters below:\\\\n\\\\n```json\\\\n\"spotify.priorityBase\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 30,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Base value of priority for all vscode-spotify elements in Status Bar(priority = basePriority+priority). This is done to avoid \\\\\\'conflicts\\\\\\' with other extensions. \"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.nextButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 8,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of next button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.previousButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 10,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of previous button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.playButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 7,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of play button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.pauseButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 6,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of pause button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.playPauseButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 9,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of play|pause button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.muteButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 5,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of mute button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.unmuteButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 4,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of unmute button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.muteUnmuteButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 3,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of mute|unmute button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.volumeUpButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 2,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of volume up button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.volumeDownButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 1,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of volume down button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.trackInfoPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 0,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of volume track info.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.toggleRepeatingButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 11,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of toggle repeating button.\"\\\\n},\\\\n\"spotify.toggleShufflingButtonPriority\": {\\\\n\\\\t\"type\": \"number\",\\\\n\\\\t\"default\": 12,\\\\n\\\\t\"description\": \"Priority of toggle shuffling button.\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Seeking to a specific point in a song\\\\nYou can use `Spotify Seek To` command (`spotify.seekTo`) to seek to the specific point in a song. You can specify hotkey that will seek to a custom time in a song by adding keybinding in keybindings.json. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n    \"command\": \"spotify.seekTo\",\\\\n    \"key\": \"alt+d\",\\\\n    \"args\": \"1:15\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[MIT LICENSE](LICENSE)\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'JMPerez/spotify-dedup\\', \\'language\\': \\'TypeScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"# Spotify Deduplicator\\\\n\\\\n[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/JMPerez/spotify-dedup.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)\\\\n\\\\nHave you ever wanted to remove duplicated songs from your Spotify library?

By automatically batching\\\\nAPI requests, it allows you to enter an artist’s name and retrieve their\\\\nentire discography in seconds, along with Spotify’s audio features and\\\\ntrack/album popularity metrics. You can also pull song and playlist\\\\ninformation for a given Spotify User (including yourself!).\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\nCRAN version 2.2.3 (recommended)\\\\n\\\\n``` r\\\\ninstall.packages(\\\\\\'spotifyr\\\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment version\\\\n\\\\n``` r\\\\ndevtools::install_github(\\\\\\'charlie86/spotifyr\\\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Authentication\\\\n\\\\nFirst, set up a Dev account with Spotify to access their Web API\\\\n[here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).\\\\nThis will give you your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Once you have\\\\nthose, you can pull your access token into R with\\\\n`get_spotify_access_token()`.\\\\n\\\\nThe easiest way to authenticate is to set your credentials to the System\\\\nEnvironment variables `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.\\\\nThe default arguments to `get_spotify_access_token()` (and all other\\\\nfunctions in this package) will refer to those. Alternatively, you can\\\\nset them manually and make sure to explicitly refer to your access token\\\\nin each subsequent function call.\\\\n\\\\n``` r\\\\nSys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = \\\\\\'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\\\\\')\\\\nSys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = \\\\\\'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\\\\\')\\\\n\\\\naccess_token <- get_spotify_access_token()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Authorization Code Flow\\\\n\\\\nFor certain functions and applications, you’ll need to log in as a\\\\nSpotify user. To do this, your Spotify Developer application needs to\\\\nhave a callback url. You can set this to whatever you want that will\\\\nwork with your application, but a good default option is\\\\n`http://localhost:1410/` (see image below). For more information on\\\\nauthorization, visit the offical [Spotify Developer\\\\nGuide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/).\\\\n\\\\n<img

The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts\\\\nthese credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as `options`\\\\nspecifying a client ID, client secret, and callback URL.\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconst SpotifyStrategy = require(\\'passport-spotify\\').Strategy;\\\\n\\\\npassport.use(\\\\n  new SpotifyStrategy(\\\\n    {\\\\n      clientID: client_id,\\\\n      clientSecret: client_secret,\\\\n      callbackURL: \\'http://localhost:8888/auth/spotify/callback\\',\\\\n    },\\\\n    function (accessToken, refreshToken, expires_in, profile, done) {\\\\n      User.findOrCreate({spotifyId: profile.id}, function (err, user) {\\\\n        return done(err, user);\\\\n      });\\\\n    }\\\\n  )\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Authenticate Requests\\\\n\\\\nUse `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `\\'spotify\\'` strategy, to\\\\nauthenticate requests.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)\\\\napplication:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\napp.get(\\'/auth/spotify\\', passport.authenticate(\\'spotify\\'));\\\\n\\\\napp.get(\\\\n  \\'/auth/spotify/callback\\',\\\\n  passport.authenticate(\\'spotify\\', {failureRedirect: \\'/login\\'}),\\\\n  function (req, res) {\\\\n    // Successful authentication, redirect home.\\\\n    res.redirect(\\'/\\');\\\\n  }\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Using scopes\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the data you want to fetch, you may want to specify custom scopes. For more information about scopes in the Spotify Web API check [their developer site](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/).\\\\n\\\\nBy default, no scope is passed. That means that you won\\'t fetch information such as display name, picture or email. You can get those by using these scopes:\\\\n\\\\n- `user-read-email`: Returns the email address of the user on Spotify, if it exists.\\\\n- `user-read-private`: Returns private information about the user such as display name and picture, if they are set.\\\\n\\\\nYou can specify the parameters in the `authenticate` call:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\napp.get(\\\\n  \\'/auth/spotify\\',\\\\n  passport.authenticate(\\'spotify\\', {\\\\n    scope: [\\'user-read-email\\', \\'user-read-private\\'],\\\\n  })\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Forcing login dialog\\\\n\\\\nYou can force the login dialog using the `showDialog` parameter when authenticating:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\napp.get(\\\\n  \\'/auth/spotify\\',\\\\n  passport.authenticate(\\'spotify\\', {\\\\n    scope: [\\'user-read-email\\', \\'user-read-private\\'],\\\\n    showDialog: true,\\\\n  })\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Examples\\\\n\\\\nFor a complete, working example, refer to the [login example](https://github.com/jmperez/passport-spotify/tree/master/examples/login).\\\\n\\\\nYou can get your keys on [Spotify - My Applications](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications).\\\\n\\\\n## Tests\\\\n\\\\n    $ npm install --dev\\\\n    $ npm test\\\\n\\\\n## Build and Coverage Status\\\\n\\\\n[![Actions Status](https://github.com/JMPerez/passport-spotify/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JMPerez/passport-spotify/actions)\\\\n\\\\n## License\\\\n\\\\n[The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'jpochyla/psst\\', \\'language\\': \\'Rust\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Psst\\\\n\\\\nFast Spotify client with native GUI, without Electron, built in Rust.

This script is **NOT** meant to circumvent buying premium! Please do consider switching to premium to support Spotify - especially if you\\\\\\'re going to use it on mobile. If the script does not work for you, help us improve it!\\\\n\\\\n### Dependencies\\\\n\\\\nUtilities used in the script:\\\\n\\\\n  - xprop\\\\n  - pacmd\\\\n  - notify-send\\\\n  - **xdotool**\\\\n\\\\nNew dependencies are highlighted in bold. Please make sure to install these before upgrading the script.\\\\n\\\\nYou will also need to have one of the following audio/media players installed:\\\\n\\\\n  - mpv\\\\n  - vlc\\\\n  - mplayer\\\\n  - mpg321\\\\n  - avplay\\\\n  - ffplay\\\\n\\\\nPlease consult the Settings section below for information on setting a custom audio player.\\\\n\\\\n[![openSUSE](https://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/468x60.png)](http://www.opensuse.org/)\\\\n\\\\nInstall all utilities + VLC on **[openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/)** with:\\\\n\\\\n    sudo zypper in binutils pulseaudio-utils libnotify-tools xdotool vlc\\\\n\\\\n[![Ubuntu](http://spreadubuntu.neomenlo.org/files/banner-468x60.png)](http://www.ubuntu.com/)\\\\n\\\\nInstall all utilities + VLC on **[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)** with:\\\\n\\\\n    sudo apt-get install x11-utils pulseaudio-utils libnotify-bin xdotool vlc\\\\n\\\\n[![Arch Linux](http://www.faderweb.de/img/archlinux.jpg)](http://www.archlinux.org/)\\\\n\\\\nThere is an [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spotify-adkiller-git/) for  **[Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/)**. To install:\\\\n\\\\n    git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/spotify-adkiller-git.git\\\\n    cd spotify-adkiller-git\\\\n    makepkg -si\\\\n\\\\n### Installation\\\\n\\\\n**Automated Installation**\\\\n\\\\nGrab the latest release of `Spotify-AdKiller`:\\\\n\\\\n    git clone https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller.git\\\\n\\\\nRun the provided installer:\\\\n\\\\n    cd Spotify-AdKiller\\\\n    ./install.sh\\\\n\\\\n**Troubleshooting**\\\\n\\\\n- `Spotify-AdKiller` has been tested to work with Spotify 0.9.x. Support for the 1.0.x beta releases has been implemented, but still needs more testing. If you run into any bugs while using `Spotify-AdKiller` with a Spotify beta release please report them on the bug tracker.\\\\n\\\\n- If you\\\\\\'ve installed Spotify from any source other than the official repository please make sure that the `spotify` executable is in your `PATH`.\\\\n\\\\n    You can create a symbolic link, if necessary (e.g. linking `my-spotify` to `spotify` if you are using the user installation of [spotify-make](https://github.com/leamas/spotify-make)).\\\\n\\\\n- The installer script will install `Spotify-AdKiller` to `$HOME/bin`, which should be recognized by Ubuntu and openSUSE.\\\\n\\\\n- If `$HOME/bin` didn\\\\\\'t exist before, a relog might be necessary to complete the installation.\\\\n\\\\n    Technical explanation: Ubuntu automatically adds `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` if it exists when you log in. Relogging reloads `$HOME/.profile` and updates your `PATH`.\\\\n\\\\n    If the script doesn\\\\\\'t work after relogging you can either [manually add](http://askubuntu.com/q/3744) `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` or follow the installation instructions below. This also applies if you\\\\\\'re using a distro that is configured differently than Ubuntu/OpenSUSE or if you want to install the script in a custom location.\\\\n\\\\n- If GUI and text are too small, you can scale the application by editing the desktop file:\\\\n\\\\n        cd /home/<your username>/.local/share/applications\\\\n        sudo gedit Spotify\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\(AdKiller\\\\\\\\).desktop\\\\n\\\\n    Add `--force-device-scale-factor=2` to scale it with factor 2:\\\\n\\\\n        Exec=spotify-wrapper.sh --force-device-scale-factor=2 %U\\\\n\\\\n**Manual Installation**\\\\n\\\\n1. Copy `spotify-adkiller.sh` and `spotify-wrapper.sh` to your `PATH` (e.g. `$HOME/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on openSUSE and Ubuntu) and make both of them executable with `chmod +x spotify-adkiller.sh` and `chmod +x spotify-wrapper.sh`.\\\\n\\\\n2. Copy `Spotify (AdKiller).desktop` to `$HOME/.local/share/applications` or any other folder your distro reads `.desktop` launchers from (e.g. `/usr/share/applications`, `/usr/local/share/applications`).\\\\n\\\\nThe default configuration file will be written automatically on the first startup of the script.\\\\n\\\\n### Usage\\\\n\\\\nIf you installed `Spotify-AdKiller` correctly, a new entry called `Spotify (AdKiller)` should appear in your menu. This launcher will start Spotify in ad-free mode. The script will terminate automatically as soon as Spotify exits. As mentioned before, **this is for testing purposes ONLY** so use this new entry only when your purposes are **testing**.\\\\n\\\\n**Important note:** Please make sure you don\\\\\\'t have notifications disabled in your Spotify configuration (`ui.track_notifications_enabled=true` in `~/.config/spotify/User/<your username>/prefs`).\\\\n\\\\n### Settings\\\\n\\\\nThe configuration file for `Spotify-AdKiller` is located under `$HOME/.config/Spotify-AdKiller/Spotify-AdKiller.cfg`. There are several settings that control how `Spotify-AdKiller` operates:\\\\n\\\\n**Modes**\\\\n\\\\n`CUSTOM_MODE` controls the ad blocking mode. The following modes are available:\\\\n\\\\n- `simple`: mute Spotify, unmute when ad is over\\\\n- `interstitial`: mute Spotify, play random local track, stop and unmute when ad is over\\\\n    + If the local track is shorter than the ad, `Spotify-AdKiller` will automatically try to loop it. This will only work with players that support a loop option. If you are planning to use this feature with a custom player make sure to also supply a custom loop option in your configuration file.\\\\n- `continuous`: mute Spotify, play random local track, stop and unmute when track is over\\\\n    + You can skip the local track as soon as the ad is over. To do so, simply press Play or Forward/Next in your Spotify client (or use the corresponding hotkeys).\\\\n    + Please note that the `continuous` ad blocking mode works best with tracks that are longer than the average ad duration (≈30-45s). If a custom track ends prematurely or is shorter than the current ad, `Spotify-AdKiller` will switch to the next random local track in line.\\\\n\\\\nThe default ad blocking mode is `continuous`.\\\\n\\\\n`Spotify-AdKiller` will always fall back to `simple` mode if no local tracks are found and/or if no supported music player is available on the system.\\\\n\\\\n**Local Playback**\\\\n\\\\nThe following settings control local music playback during ads:\\\\n\\\\n- `CUSTOM_PLAYER`: local music player to use; chosen automatically by default\\\\n- `CUSTOM_LOOPOPT`: loop option for custom player (e.g. `-loop 0`); we recommend setting this if you are planning to use interstitial adblocking mode\\\\n- `CUSTOM_VOLUME`: volume of local playback; set to 100 by default\\\\n- `CUSTOM_MUSIC`: local track to play / local music directory to choose tracks from; set to XDG standard music directory by default (e.g. `$HOME/Music`)\\\\n\\\\n**Debug Setting**\\\\n\\\\nYou can make the CLI output more verbose and enable the log file by setting `DEBUG` to `1`. The log will be written to `$HOME/.Spotify-AdKiller.log` and replaced each time `Spotify-AdKiller` runs.\\\\n\\\\n### Important Notes\\\\n\\\\nPlease make sure to always use the provided launcher when running Spotify. Under some circumstances Spotify might remain muted when exiting the application. This is a technical limitation with `PulseAudio`. `Spotify-AdKiller` automatically unmutes Spotify when initially run.\\\\n\\\\nIf, for some reason, Spotify does remain muted you can use the following command to unmute it manually while it\\\\\\'s running:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nfor i in $(LC_ALL=C pactl list | grep -E \\\\\\'(^Sink Input)|(media.name = \\\\\\\\\"Spotify\\\\\\\\\"$)\\\\\\' | cut -d \\\\\\\\# -f2 | grep -v Spotify); do pactl set-sink-input-mute \"$i\" no; done\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Similar Projects\\\\n\\\\n- [blockify](https://github.com/mikar/blockify) - automatic/blacklist-based ad-blocker written in Python\\\\n- [spotify_ad_blocker_linux.rb](https://github.com/superr4y/hacks/blob/master/spotify/spotify_ad_blocker_linux.rb) - automatic ad-blocker written in Ruby\\\\n- [spotify-blacklist-mute](https://github.com/ysangkok/spotify-blacklist-mute) - blacklist-based muting, written in Bash\\\\n\\\\n### License\\\\n\\\\nMany people have contributed to make our script become what it is today (huge shout-out to the initial creator [pcworld](https://github.com/pcworld)).

spotify-ripper\\\\n\\\\nA fork of [spotify-ripper](https://github.com/robbeofficial/spotifyripper) that uses [pyspotify](https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify) v2.x\\\\n\\\\nSpotify-ripper is a small ripper script for Spotify that rips Spotify URIs to MP3 files and includes ID3 tags and cover art.\\\\n\\\\n**Note that stream ripping violates the libspotify\\\\\\'s ToS**\\\\n\\\\n## Features\\\\n\\\\n* real-time VBR or CBR ripping from spotify PCM stream\\\\n\\\\n* writes id3 tags (including album covers)\\\\n\\\\n* creates files and directories based on the following structure artist/album/artist - song.mp3\\\\n\\\\n* optionally skip existing files\\\\n\\\\n* accepts tracks, playlists, albums, and artist URIs\\\\n\\\\n* search for tracks using Spotify queries\\\\n\\\\n* options for interactive login (no password in shell history) and relogin using previous credentials\\\\n\\\\n* option to remove tracks from playlist after successful ripping\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\n```shell\\\\nusage: ripper [-h] [-b {160,320,96}] [-c] [-d DIRECTORY] [-u USER]\\\\n              [-p PASSWORD] [-l] [-m] [-o] [-v VBR]\\\\n              uri\\\\n\\\\nRips Spotify URIs

This will allow saving your password securely between launches.\\\\n\\\\nIn GNOME, things should work out of the box. It might be a bit trickier to get it working in other DEs: see this [ArchWiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring) for detailed explanations on how to automatically start the daemon with your session.\\\\n\\\\nBear special attention to the fact that to enable automatic login, you might have to use the same password for your user account and for the keyring, and that the keyring might need to be [set as default](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Passwords_are_not_remembered).\\\\n\\\\nSee [this comment](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/92#issuecomment-801852593) for more details!\\\\n\\\\n### Login in with Facebook\\\\n\\\\n...is not supported. However, you can update your account in order to be able to log in with a username and password [as explained in this issue](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/373).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Settings\\\\n\\\\nSpot can also be configured via `gsettings` if you want to change the audio backend, the song bitrate, etc. [A GUI is planned but not available yet.](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/142)\\\\n\\\\n### Seek bar warping\\\\nIt is possible to click on the seek bar to navigate to that position in a song. If you are having issues with this not working you may have [gtk-primary-button-warps-slider](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/property.Settings.gtk-primary-button-warps-slider.html) set to false.\\\\nIn order to fix this issue set the value to true in your gtk configuration.\\\\n\\\\n### Scrobbling\\\\n\\\\nScrobbling is not supported directly by Spot. However, you can use a tool such a [rescrobbled](https://github.com/InputUsername/rescrobbled) ([see #85](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/85)).\\\\n\\\\n### Lyrics\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, Spot does not display lyrics for songs, but you can use [osdlyrics](https://github.com/osdlyrics/osdlyrics)  ([see #226](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/226)).\\\\n\\\\n### Gtk theme\\\\n\\\\nSpot uses the dark theme variant by default; this can be changed using `gsettings`.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are using the flatpak version, don\\\\\\'t forget to install your theme with flatpak as well. See [this comment](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/209#issuecomment-860180537) for details.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, snap also requires that you install the corresponding snap for your theme. See [this comment](https://github.com/xou816/spot/issues/338#issuecomment-975543476) for details.\\\\n\\\\n## Features\\\\n\\\\n**Only works with premium accounts!**\\\\n\\\\n- playback control (play/pause, prev/next, seeking, shuffle, repeat (none, all, song))\\\\n- selection mode: easily browse and select mutliple tracks to queue them\\\\n- browse your saved albums and playlists\\\\n- search albums and artists\\\\n- view an artist\\\\\\'s releases\\\\n- view users\\\\\\' playlists\\\\n- view album info\\\\n- credentials management with Secret Service\\\\n- MPRIS integration\\\\n\\\\n### Planned\\\\n\\\\n- playlist management (creation and edition)\\\\n- liked tracks\\\\n- GNOME search provider?\\\\n- improved search? (track results)\\\\n- recommendations?\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing\\\\n\\\\nContributions are welcome! If you wish, add yourself to the `AUTHORS` files when submitting your contribution.\\\\n\\\\nFor any large feature/change, please consider opening an issue first to discuss implementation and design decisions.\\\\n\\\\n### Translating\\\\n\\\\nTranslations are managed using `gettext` and are available in the `po/` subdirectory.\\\\n\\\\n**I am now experimenting an online service, [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=xfVrpQfRBM), to manage translations; PRs are still welcome if you feel like using these instead!**\\\\n\\\\nIf you feel like it, you are welcome to open a PR to be added to the `TRANSLATORS` file!\\\\n\\\\n## Building\\\\n\\\\n### With GNOME Builder and flatpak\\\\n\\\\nPre-requisite: install the `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable` SDK extension with flatpak. Builder might do this for you automatically, but it will install an older version; make sure  the version installed matches the version of the Freedesktop SDK GNOME uses.\\\\n\\\\nOpen the project in GNOME Builder and make the `dev.alextren.Spot.development.json` configuration active. Then build :)\\\\n\\\\n### Manually\\\\n\\\\nRequires Rust (stable), **GTK4**, and a couple other things. Also requires **libadwaita**: it is not packaged on all distros at the moment, you might have to build it yourself!\\\\n\\\\nWith meson:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nmeson target -Dbuildtype=debug -Doffline=false --prefix=\"$HOME/.local\"\\\\nninja install -C target\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will install a `.desktop` file among other things, and the spot executable will be put in `.local/bin` (you might want to add it to your path).\\\\n\\\\nTo build an optimized release build, use `-Dbuildtype=release` instead.\\\\n\\\\n### Regenerating potfiles\\\\n\\\\nWhen adding new `msgids`, don\\\\\\'t forget to regenerate/update the potfiles.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nninja spot-pot -C target\\\\nninja spot-update-po -C target\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Pulling updated strings from POEditor\\\\n\\\\nWe are now using POEditor and the wonderful [`poeditor-sync`](https://github.com/mick88/poeditor-sync) tool.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npoeditor pull\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Regenerating sources for flatpak\\\\n\\\\nUsing [flatpak-cargo-generator.py](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/cargo):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nninja cargo-sources.json -C target\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Debugging\\\\n\\\\nSet the `RUST_LOG` env variable to the appropriate level.\\\\n\\\\nDebug builds (flatpak) are available from the master branch on Github (see the `spot-snaphots` action).\\\\n\\\\nSpot caches images and HTTP responses in `~/.cache/spot`.\\\\n\\\\nSpot uses [isahc](https://github.com/sagebind/isahc), which uses libcurl, therefore you can set the `https_proxy` env variable to help with debugging.

This program acts as a \"wrapper\" around Spotify\\\\nto translate media key signals from Gnome and send them to the Spotify client.\\\\n\\\\nIt supports the play/pause, stop, next, and previous signals, and is compatible with\\\\nboth Gnome 2 and Gnome 3.\\\\n\\\\nNEW Jan 2013 - Get Now Playing integration for telepathy based clients such as \\\\nEmpathy,Pidgin,Kde Telepathy Sugar using lib telepahty support from gobject-introspection - dhananjaysathe@gmail.com\\\\nEdit : Added basic advertisement filtering for advertisements in the telepathy statuses\\\\n\\\\nMany thanks to [Mike Houston at kothar.net](http://kothar.net/index.php/blog/30-spotifydbus)\\\\nand [Fran Diéguez at Mabishu](http://www.mabishu.com/blog/2010/11/15/playing-with-d-bus-interface-of-spotify-for-linux/)\\\\nfor their blog postings that pointed me in the right directions to get this implemented.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nVerify that your copy of Spotify installed its binary to `/usr/bin/spotify`:\\\\n\\\\n    $ which spotify\\\\n\\\\t/usr/bin/spotify\\\\n\\\\nIf it was installed to a different location, you will need to edit `bin/spotify` to set\\\\n`spotify_bin` to the appropriate path.\\\\n\\\\nCopy `bin/spotify` to `/usr/local/bin/spotify`, or a different path that takes precedent\\\\nover the location of your `spotify` binary:\\\\n\\\\n    $ sudo install bin/spotify /usr/local/bin/\\\\n\\\\nLaunching `spotify` via application launcher or from the command line should now start\\\\nthe wrapper first, which will then launch the real Spotify client.  Enjoy having media\\\\nkeys that work for both Spotify and other media players.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSupport\\\\n-------\\\\n\\\\nSpotify-Gnome was created by [John Reese](http://johnmreese.com), and copyright (c) 2011.\\\\nTelepathy support - [Dhananjay Sathe](dhananjaysathe@gmail.com)\\\\nNotification support - [Matthew Bray](http://bf.mattjbray.com)\\\\nSpotify-Gnome is licensed under the MIT license.

I\\\\\\'m only doing bug fixes on this repo and I don\\\\\\'t really have a whole lot of time to update it. [react-native-spotify-remote](https://github.com/cjam/react-native-spotify-remote) is being worked on by someone else to use the newer \"remote\" SDK.\\\\n\\\\n## Install\\\\n\\\\nTo add the Spotify SDK to your project, cd into your project directory and run the following commands:\\\\n```bash\\\\nnpm install --save rn-spotify-sdk\\\\nreact-native link react-native-events\\\\nreact-native link rn-spotify-sdk\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNext, do the manual setup for each platform:\\\\n\\\\n#### iOS\\\\nManually add `SpotifyMetadata.framework` and `SpotifyAudioPlayback.framework` from `node_modules/rn-spotify-sdk/ios/external/SpotifySDK` to *Linked Frameworks and Libraries* in your project settings. Then add `../node_modules/rn-spotify-sdk/ios/external/SpotifySDK` to *Framework Search Paths* in your project settings.\\\\n\\\\n#### Android\\\\n\\\\nEdit `android/build.gradle` and add `flatDir`\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n...\\\\nallprojects {\\\\n\\\\trepositories {\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tmavenLocal()\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tjcenter()\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tmaven {\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t// All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\turl \"$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tflatDir {\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tdirs project(\\\\\\':rn-spotify-sdk\\\\\\').file(\\\\\\'libs\\\\\\'), \\\\\\'libs\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n\\\\t}\\\\n}\\\\n...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nEdit `android/app/build.gradle` and add `packagingOptions`\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n...\\\\nbuildTypes {\\\\n    release {\\\\n        minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds\\\\n        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(\"proguard-android.txt\"), \"proguard-rules.pro\"\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\npackagingOptions {\\\\n    pickFirst \\\\\\'lib/armeabi-v7a/libgnustl_shared.so\\\\\\'\\\\n    pickFirst \\\\\\'lib/x86/libgnustl_shared.so\\\\\\'\\\\n    exclude \\\\\\'lib/arm64-v8a/libgnustl_shared.so\\\\\\'\\\\n    exclude \\\\\\'lib/x86_64/libgnustl_shared.so\\\\\\'\\\\n}\\\\n...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn some cases, the two `exclude` lines cause issues when compiling and can be omitted. I need to look further into what causes this.\\\\n\\\\nOn Android, `react-native link` has a bug where it imports `RNSpotifyPackage` using the wrong bundle. You may have to make the following change to `MainApplication.java`:\\\\n```java\\\\n...\\\\nimport com.spotify.sdk.android.authentication.RNSpotifyPackage; // remove this line\\\\nimport com.lufinkey.react.spotify.RNSpotifyPackage; // replace with this line\\\\n...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you have issues linking the module, please check that gradle is updated to the latest version and that your project is synced.

All of the events except for **\\\\\\'disconnect\\\\\\'** / **\\\\\\'reconnect\\\\\\'** (on Android) and **\\\\\\'login\\\\\\'** / **\\\\\\'logout\\\\\\'** come from Spotify\\\\\\'s native SDK and are simply forwarded to javascript. If one of these events occurs at a weird time or has strange data, please open an issue on Spotify\\\\\\'s [ios-streaming-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/ios-streaming-sdk) or [android-streaming-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/android-streaming-sdk) repo, and not here.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'login\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `session` {Session}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the module has successfully logged in.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'logout\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the module is logged out.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'sessionRenewed\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `session` {Session}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the session has been renewed.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'play\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when playback has started or has resumed.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'pause\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when playback is paused.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'trackChange\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when playback of a new/different track starts.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'metadataChange\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when metadata has changed. This event occurs when playback starts or changes to a different context, when a track switch occurs, etc. This is an informational event that does not require action, but should be used to keep the UI display updated with the latest metadata information.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'contextChange\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when playback starts or changes to a different context than was playing before, such as a change in album or playlist.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'shuffleStatusChange\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when \"shuffle\" is switched on or off.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'repeatStatusChange\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when \"repeat\" is switched on or off.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'active\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when this device has become the active playback device. This event occurs when the users moves playback to this device using Spotify Connect.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'inactive\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when this device is no longer the active playback device. This event occurs when the user moves playback to a different device using Spotify Connect.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'permissionLost\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when this device has temporarily lost permission to stream audio from Spotify. A user can only stream audio on one of her devices at any given time. If playback is started on a different device, this event may occur.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'audioFlush\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the application should flush its audio buffers (you don\\\\\\'t need to deal with this since that\\\\\\'s handled by the native code). For example, this event occurs when seeking to a different position within a track.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'audioDeliveryDone\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the library reaches the end of a playback context and has no more audio to deliver.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'trackDelivered\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `event` {PlaybackEvent}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the application accepted all samples from the current track. This is an informative event that indicates that all samples from the current track have been delivered to and accepted by the application. The track has not yet finished playing the last audio sample, but no more audio will be delivered for this track. For nearly all intents and purposes, the track has finished playing.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'disconnect\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the player loses network connectivity.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'reconnect\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when the player regains network connectivity.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'temporaryPlayerError\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tEmitted when service has been interrupted, usually by lack of network access. However, it can also occur if there is a problem with Spotify\\\\\\'s backend services, or also when the user switches from WiFi to 3G. These errors can occur in many non-critical situations, and thus it is not necessary to show toasts or alert dialogs when receiving this event, or else you will unnecessarily annoy or panic the user. However, it can be useful to know about these events if operations are consistently failing, in which case showing a toast or alert may be justified.\\\\n\\\\n- **\\\\\\'playerMessage\\\\\\'**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t- `message` {String}\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\tCalled when the player has recieved a message for the end user from the Spotify service.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Initialization/Authorization Methods\\\\n\\\\n- **initialize**( *options* )\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tInitializes the Spotify module and resumes a logged in session if there is one.

If you are not familiar with them, [Understanding Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/learn/refresh-tokens/) can give you a basic idea on how they work.\\\\n\\\\n## Additional notes\\\\n\\\\nThis module only works for Spotify Premium users.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'spotify/web-api-auth-examples\\', \\'language\\': \\'HTML\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify Accounts Authentication Examples\\\\n\\\\nThis project contains basic demos showing the different OAuth 2.0 flows for [authenticating against the Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).\\\\n\\\\nThese examples cover:\\\\n\\\\n* Authorization Code flow\\\\n* Client Credentials flow\\\\n* Implicit Grant flow\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\nThese examples run on Node.js. On [its website](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) you can find instructions on how to install it. You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm.\\\\n\\\\nOnce installed, clone the repository and install its dependencies running:\\\\n\\\\n    $ npm install\\\\n\\\\n### Using your own credentials\\\\nYou will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the Spotify for Developers Dashboard.\\\\n\\\\nTo do so, go to [your Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create your application. For the examples, we registered these Redirect URIs:\\\\n\\\\n* http://localhost:8888 (needed for the implicit grant flow)\\\\n* http://localhost:8888/callback\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have created your app, replace the `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `client_secret` in the examples with the ones you get from My Applications.\\\\n\\\\n## Running the examples\\\\nIn order to run the different examples, open the folder with the name of the flow you want to try out, and run its `app.js` file. For instance, to run the Authorization Code example do:\\\\n\\\\n    $ cd authorization_code\\\\n    $ node app.js\\\\n\\\\nThen, open `http://localhost:8888` in a browser.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine\\', \\'language\\': \\'Jupyter Notebook\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'<h1 align=\"center\">Spotify Recommendation Engine</h1>\\\\n<p align=\"center\">\\\\n <img src=\"https://ucalyptus.github.io/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine/spotify.gif\" width=400>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## About the Project:\\\\n#### Check my video to understand this project better.\\\\n\\\\n[![Check my video to understand this project better.](images/Capture1.PNG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otrW8brCAiU)\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n* spotipy\\\\n```bash\\\\n pip install spotipy\\\\n```\\\\n[Spotify Developer](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for more info \\\\n\\\\n## Recommender System:\\\\n## [Notebook](https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/Spotify_Recommendation_System_.ipynb) | [Playlist created using the notebook](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4D8p3hVYwgngTmf1FHol0Y)\\\\n\\\\n# Engage in the [Discussions](https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine/discussions) for more questions.\\\\n\\\\n### Contributing\\\\nPlease see the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.\\\\nCheck the [Wiki](https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine/wiki) for instructions.\\\\n\\\\n## 🌟 Contributors \\\\n\\\\nThanks to these wonderful people ✨✨:\\\\n\\\\n<table>\\\\n\\\\t<tr>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t<td>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<a href=\"https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine/graphs/contributors\">\\\\n  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine\" />\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t</a>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t</td>\\\\n\\\\t</tr>\\\\n</table>\\\\n\\\\n## Star History\\\\n\\\\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine&type=Timeline)](https://star-history.com/#ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine&Timeline)\\\\n\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'guilhermesad/rspotify\\', \\'language\\': \\'Ruby\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# RSpotify\\\\n\\\\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rspotify.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rspotify)\\\\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify/actions)\\\\n\\\\nThis is a ruby wrapper for the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api).\\\\n\\\\n## Features\\\\n\\\\n* [Full documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/guilhermesad/rspotify/master)\\\\n* Full API Endpoint coverage\\\\n* OAuth and other authorization flows\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\nAdd this line to your application\\\\\\'s Gemfile:\\\\n\\\\n    gem \\\\\\'rspotify\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nAnd then execute:\\\\n\\\\n    $ bundle\\\\n\\\\nOr install it yourself as:\\\\n\\\\n    $ gem install rspotify\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\nRSpotify was designed with usability as its primary goal, so that you can forget the API and intuitively interact with your playlists, favorite artists, users and so on.\\\\n\\\\nYou can write things like `my_playlist.tracks.sort_by(&:popularity).last.album` without having to think which API calls must be done.

You can see the list of available scopes in [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/).\\\\n\\\\nNext, make a link so the user can log in with his Spotify account:\\\\n\\\\n```ruby\\\\n<%= link_to \\\\\\'Sign in with Spotify\\\\\\', \\\\\\'/auth/spotify\\\\\\', method: :post %>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAnd create a route to receive the callback:\\\\n\\\\n```ruby\\\\n# config/routes.rb\\\\n\\\\nget \\\\\\'/auth/spotify/callback\\\\\\', to: \\\\\\'users#spotify\\\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRemember you need to tell Spotify this address is white-listed. You can do this by adding it to the Redirect URIs list in your [application page](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications). An example of Redirect URI would be http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, create a new RSpotify User with the response received:\\\\n\\\\n```ruby\\\\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\\\\n  def spotify\\\\n    spotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(request.env[\\\\\\'omniauth.auth\\\\\\'])\\\\n    # Now you can access user\\\\\\'s private data, create playlists and much more\\\\n\\\\n    # Access private data\\\\n    spotify_user.country #=> \"US\"\\\\n    spotify_user.email   #=> \"example@email.com\"\\\\n\\\\n    # Create playlist in user\\\\\\'s Spotify account\\\\n    playlist = spotify_user.create_playlist!(\\\\\\'my-awesome-playlist\\\\\\')\\\\n\\\\n    # Add tracks to a playlist in user\\\\\\'s Spotify account\\\\n    tracks = RSpotify::Track.search(\\\\\\'Know\\\\\\')\\\\n    playlist.add_tracks!(tracks)\\\\n    playlist.tracks.first.name #=> \"Somebody That I Used To Know\"\\\\n\\\\n    # Access and modify user\\\\\\'s music library\\\\n    spotify_user.save_tracks!(tracks)\\\\n    spotify_user.saved_tracks.size #=> 20\\\\n    spotify_user.remove_tracks!(tracks)\\\\n\\\\n    albums = RSpotify::Album.search(\\\\\\'launeddas\\\\\\')\\\\n    spotify_user.save_albums!(albums)\\\\n    spotify_user.saved_albums.size #=> 10\\\\n    spotify_user.remove_albums!(albums)\\\\n\\\\n    # Use Spotify Follow features\\\\n    spotify_user.follow(playlist)\\\\n    spotify_user.follows?(artists)\\\\n    spotify_user.unfollow(users)\\\\n\\\\n    # Get user\\\\\\'s top played artists and tracks\\\\n    spotify_user.top_artists #=> (Artist array)\\\\n    spotify_user.top_tracks(time_range: \\\\\\'short_term\\\\\\') #=> (Track array)\\\\n\\\\n    # Check doc for more\\\\n  end\\\\nend\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Refreshing the access token\\\\n\\\\nThe user\\\\\\'s access token is automatically refreshed by RSpotify when needed. This is especially useful if you persist\\\\nthe user data on a database. This way, the user only need log in to Spotify once during the use of the application.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you can store a proc that is invoked when a new access token is generated. This give you the\\\\nopportunity to persist the new access token for future use. The proc will be invoked with two arguments: the\\\\nnew access token and the lifetime of the token in seconds. For example, if lifetime value returned from\\\\nSpotify is 3600, you know that the token will be good for one hour.\\\\n\\\\nIn the sample code below, the credentials have been retrieved from some persistent store such as\\\\nAWS SecretsManager.\\\\n\\\\n```ruby\\\\n\\\\ncallback_proc = Proc.new { |new_access_token, token_lifetime |\\\\n   now = Time.now.utc.to_i  # seconds since 1/1/1970, midnight UTC\\\\n   deadline = now+token_lifetime\\\\n   #puts(\"new access token will expire at #{Time.at(deadline).utc.to_s}\")\\\\n   self.save_new_access_token(new_access_token)\\\\n }\\\\n\\\\nspotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\\'credentials\\\\\\' => {\\\\n       \"token\" => self.credentials[\"access_token\"],\\\\n       \"refresh_token\" => self.credentials[\"refresh_token\"],\\\\n       \"access_refresh_callback\" => callback_proc\\\\n    } ,\\\\n    \\\\\\'id\\\\\\' => self.credentials[\"user_id\"]\\\\n  })\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRSpotify provides a way to facilitate persistence:\\\\n\\\\n```ruby\\\\nhash = spotify_user.to_hash\\\\n# hash containing all user attributes, including access tokens\\\\n\\\\n# Use the hash to persist the data the way you prefer...\\\\n\\\\n# Then recover the Spotify user whenever you like\\\\nspotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(hash)\\\\nspotify_user.create_playlist!(\\\\\\'my_awesome_playlist\\\\\\') # automatically refreshes token\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Getting raw response\\\\n\\\\nTo get the raw response from Spotify API requests, just toggle the `raw_response` variable:\\\\n\\\\n```ruby\\\\nRSpotify.raw_response = true\\\\nRSpotify::Artist.search(\\\\\\'Cher\\\\\\') #=> (String with raw json response)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Notes\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'d like to use OAuth outside rails, have a look [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization_code_flow) for the requests that need to be made. You should be able to pass the response to RSpotify::User.new just as well, and from there easily create playlists and more for your user.\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing\\\\n\\\\n1.

HipHopHeads is a subreddit dedicated to everything hiphop, including the latest mixtapes, videos, news, and anything else hip hop related from your favorite artists.\\\\n\\\\n## New Features!\\\\n[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) has recently been added to the project. You can read up on how to get it setup [here](flask.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started\\\\n\\\\n### Prerequisites\\\\n\\\\nThis project uses Python3.\\\\n\\\\nYou will need to setup a Spotify developer account and register your app and obtain the following information:\\\\n* client id\\\\n* client secret\\\\n* your spotify username\\\\n* playlist id of the playlist you want to add the tracks to\\\\n* the url you want to redirect to for authentication, i.e. http://google.com/\\\\n  * this must be added under your app settings > Redirect URIs \\\\n\\\\nYou will also need to setup a reddit instance with praw. [Here\\\\\\'s](https://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/) a useful guide I used to do this.\\\\n\\\\n### Setup your Credentials\\\\n\\\\nTo set up your credentials, create a new file called `credentials.json` in the root of the project with the following contents:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n    \"spotify\": {\\\\n        \"username\": \"[Spotify username]\",\\\\n        \"client_id\": \"[Spotify client id]\",\\\\n        \"client_secret\": \"[Spotify client secret]\",\\\\n        \"redirect\": \"[redirect uri]\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    \"reddit\": {\\\\n        \"username\": \"[reddit username]\",\\\\n        \"client_id\": \"[praw client id]\",\\\\n        \"client_secret\": \"[praw client secret]\"\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n \\\\n### Installing dependencies\\\\nThis project uses a dependency manager called [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io). Follow the instructions to install it [here](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv).\\\\n\\\\nThe project dependencies are listed in a [Pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile). Using pipenv, you can install all the dependencies with the following commands:\\\\n```bash\\\\ncd fresh_script\\\\npipenv install\\\\n``` \\\\n\\\\nPipenv uses [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to create a python environment with all the dependencies listed in the Pipfile. Before running the fresh.py script, you must first activate the environment:\\\\n```bash\\\\npipenv shell\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you wish to deactivate the environment use the command\\\\n```bash\\\\nexit\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Running the script\\\\n\\\\nRunning the program is simple. The first time you run it, you will be asked for your Spotify credientials which will be saved to a config file for ease of use in the future. Choose to sort results by hot or new, enter a post limit, and then enjoy.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npython3 fresh.py\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Script arguments\\\\n\\\\nThe following arguments can be passed to the script\\\\n\\\\n| Short | Long             | Type   | Description |\\\\n|-------|------------------|--------|-------------|\\\\n| -s    | --sort           | string | Sort by hot, new, rising, random_rising, controversion or top |\\\\n| -l    | --limit          | int    | How many posts to grab |\\\\n| -t    | --threshold      | int    | Only posts with score above threshold |\\\\n| -f    | --fresh          | bool   | Only add tracks with the \\\\\\\\[FRESH\\\\\\\\] tag |\\\\n| -ia   | --include-albums | bool   | Include tracks from albums |\\\\n| -v    | --verbose        | bool   | Output songs being added and other info |\\\\n| -p    | --playlists      | bool   | List, add, or remove playlists to add songs to |\\\\n\\\\n### Running the script using cron\\\\n\\\\nWe can use cron to automatically run the script periodically in order to keep it up-to-date. You will need either a macOS computer or Linux server to use cron.\\\\n\\\\n1. Follow the `running the script` instructions to make sure your `.config.ini` file is generated with the required parameters\\\\n2. Run `crontab -e` to open the cron editor, which is similar to vim\\\\n3. Use the following format to create a line for your cron\\\\n    ```\\\\n    * * * * * command to be executed\\\\n    - - - - -\\\\n    | | | | |\\\\n    | | | | ----- Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)\\\\n    | | | ------- Month (1 - 12)\\\\n    | | --------- Day of month (1 - 31)\\\\n    | ----------- Hour (0 - 23)\\\\n    ------------- Minute (0 - 59)\\\\n    ```\\\\n    For example, you would do the following to run this everyday at 9AM\\\\n    ```\\\\n    0 9 * * * python /home/jsmith/fresh.py\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing\\\\n\\\\nI appreciate any help and support.

If those changes would be useful in the project, feel free to make a pull request.\\\\n\\\\n### Deploy the skill\\\\n1. Create a Spotify developer app at developer.spotify.com, get a client ID and client secret\\\\n2. Create an Amazon Alexa skill, choosing **custom**. When you get to the part in the Alexa developer console where you can upload/paste in JSON, run `skill/skill.js` to generate the JSON required\\\\n```\\\\n$ node skill/skill.js\\\\n```\\\\n3. Enter the application ID from the developer console into `package.json`, under the key `alexa.applicationId`. \\\\n4. Turn on **Account linking**, choosing **\"Auth Code Grant\"**. Set **\"Authorization URI\"** to `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize`,  **\"Access Token URI\"** to `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`, set client ID and secret, add scopes `user-read-playback-state` and `user-modify-playback-state`, and the three redirect URLs from the account linking details in your developer console for the skill\\\\n5. Deploy this webapp to somewhere that **supports HTTPS** (required for Alexa skills), for example [Render](https://render.com/)\\\\n6. Configure the skill to use an HTTPS endpoint of `https://<your-url>/<app-name>` where `app-name` is the name specified in `alexa.app(\\\\\\'app-name\\\\\\')`, `connect` by default\\\\n\\\\n### Adding a language\\\\n1. Check that the locale is supported by Amazon (see [list of supported locale codes](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/develop-skills-in-multiple-languages.html#h2-code-changes)) and get your locale code (e.g. `en-GB`)\\\\n2. Create a locale file in `locales/{LOCALE-CODE}.json` (see existing locales for formatting), please do not change the placeholder value names (in double curly brackets e.g. `{{name}}`)\\\\n3. Create a localised _interaction model_ used by Skill Builder in `skill/locales/{LOCALE-CODE}.json` (please only change the values for the samples for each intent and not the intent names or slots). The formatting should be similar to the other locales, but if more (or fewer) samples are required for the language add as many as possible (more samples mean better accuracy) (formatting done by [alexa-utterances](https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-utterances/blob/master/README.md))\\\\n4. Add the locale to the list of locales in `skill/skill-i18n.js` (follow the format used by other locales)\\\\n5. Please also provide [publishing information](https://github.com/thorpelawrence/alexa-spotify-connect/issues/14#issuecomment-365770234) as a comment in your pull request so that it can be localised and published to Amazon in the new language\\\\n6.

Searches Spotify, controls your music, generally rocks?\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s built off a lot of other people\\\\\\'s work—\\\\n[PHPFunk](https://github.com/phpfunk/alfred-spotify-controls) and\\\\n[David Ferguson](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/) especially— and tries to match\\\\nthe functionality of Alfred\\\\\\'s integrated iTunes player. It\\\\\\'s not perfect, but it does the job. And I think it\\\\\\'s pretty cool.\\\\n\\\\n## Features ##\\\\n\\\\nA quick rundown of its coolness:\\\\n\\\\n### A controller, not a workflow ###\\\\n\\\\nSpotifious just *feels* fun to use, like a real plugin for Alfred, not a workflow. It\\\\ncan do in-depth, album-scouring searches and gives you useful information even if something goes wrong. Filter by artist or album, search for specific tracks or just plain see what\\\\\\'s playing. It\\\\\\'s all there.\\\\n\\\\nNot unlike the iTunes Mini Player.\\\\n\\\\n### Alfred-like ###\\\\n\\\\nSpotifious is also especially Alfred-like. Just start typing to scour Spotify\\\\\\'s servers for music. Browse through artists and albums like nobody\\\\\\'s business and drill down through Queen\\\\\\'s huge anthologies with a snappy context-based search and filtering. Your frequent searches rise to the top, and your controls pop up with the letter `c`.\\\\n\\\\n### Smart ###\\\\n\\\\nSpotifious uses Packal to make sure you always have the latest version. It gives you a heads-up about what\\\\\\'s going on with Spotify *the moment you start it*. And don\\\\\\'t worry about errors— we\\\\\\'ll handle those. All you have to do is choose how you want to pop it up on screen.\\\\n\\\\n## Download & Install ##\\\\n\\\\nLatest version: [v0.13.9](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip) | Latest dev build: [v0.13.9](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/dev.zip)\\\\n\\\\nAn in-depth [installation guide](http://ben.stolovitz.com/Spotify-for-Alfred/download/) is available on the Spotifious website.\\\\n\\\\n1. [Download](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip)\\\\nthis repository.\\\\n2. Open `Spotifious.alfredworkflow` in the `dist` folder by double-clicking it or dragging it into\\\\nAlfred.\\\\n3. Double-click the first thingy marked `Hotkey`.\\\\n4. Click the textfield labeled `Hotkey` and press `^⌘⏎`.\\\\n5. Click `Save` to store the binding.\\\\n6. Bind the other hotkeys as you wish. Their actions are visible in the `Text` field, under `Argument`.\\\\n7. Pop up Spotifious with the key command you set— I would have `^⌘⏎`.\\\\n8. Follow the instructions on the set-up menu.\\\\n\\\\t1. You\\\\\\'ll be asked to choose your country (for better search results— you can opt out).\\\\n\\\\t2. You\\\\\\'ll create a Spotify application (or not, you can opt out).\\\\n\\\\t3. You\\\\\\'ll link the new app to Spotifious.\\\\n10. Continue on with your merry day— but now with Spotifious.\\\\n\\\\n![A visual install guide](include/screenshots/install.png)\\\\n\\\\n## How to Use ##\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\\\\\'s assume you\\\\\\'ve downloaded and installed the workflow. Now what?\\\\n\\\\n1. Press `^⌘⏎`.\\\\n\\\\nGood! You should briefly see a loading entry, then the main menu:\\\\n\\\\n![Loading...](include/screenshots/loading.png)\\\\n![Main Menu](include/screenshots/main_menu.png)\\\\n\\\\nYou can action the song title (press `⏎`) to play or pause the song, action \\\\nthe album or artist to search for that album or artist, or just start typing to \\\\nsearch for cool music.\\\\n\\\\n![Some cool screenshots](include/screenshots/compilation.png)\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\\\\\'ve searched for something, you can continue to browse albums and arists through Spotifious. Actioning an artist will bring up a list of their albums, and actioning an album will bring up the track list.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re looking through a really long album or a particularly prodigious artist, you can also narrow your search by typing a little more— Spotifious will search for results within the album or artist.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** You can always leave a menu and go back just by pressing `⌫`.\\\\n\\\\nYou can access a small controls menu by typing `c` at the main menu.\\\\n\\\\n![A preview of the controls menu](include/screenshots/controls.png)\\\\n\\\\nYou can change your settings by typing `s` at the main menu.\\\\n\\\\n![The settings menu](include/screenshots/settings.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Acknowledgements ##\\\\n\\\\nA lot of people helped out on this:\\\\n\\\\n- **vdesabou** and I trade ideas a ton\\\\n- **PHPfunk** and his PHP Alfred workflow inspired much of `OhAlfred`\\\\n- **David Ferguson** helped with some iffy Alfred glitches\\\\n- **jwilsson**\\\\\\'s [Spotify PHP web API](http://jwilsson.github.io/spotify-web-api-php/).\\\\n- a slightly modified version of [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/) icon font face for icons.\\\\n- and many other people mentioned in the code.\\\\n\\\\nThanks to everyone who helped, and thanks to everyone who uses my work!\\\\nOh, and thanks for reading this whole README. I hope you enjoy Spotifious!\\\\n\\\\n## Development ##\\\\n\\\\nYou must install dependencies manually. Install \\\\n[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and then run `make init`. Then you can\\\\nproceed with development! (if you do not want to do a global install, run\\\\n`php composer.phar install` from this directory)\\\\n\\\\nCommand line development for Alfred 3 is currently not working, since we \\\\ndepend on several environment variables. Eventually, if you are developing for \\\\nAlfred version 3 and want to run these files from\\\\nthe command line (`php -f main.php -- \"args\"`), you will need to run in debug\\\\nmode : `DEBUG=true php -f main.php -- \"args\"`.\\\\n\\\\n### Deployment ###\\\\n\\\\n1. Bump version here\\\\n2. Update `CHANGELOG`\\\\n3. Update `.alfredworkflow` version\\\\n4. Update Alfred forum\\\\n5. Update Packal\\\\n6. Update GitHub Pages site\\\\n\\\\n## TODO ##\\\\n\\\\n- Allow `⎇`, `^`, and `⌘` to function as modifiers (Open in Spotify, other things?).\\\\n- More in-depth Spotify control (radio, queuing, playlists)\\\\n- Make main menu links go directly to menus.\\\\n\\\\n## Changelog ##\\\\n\\\\nThis project uses pseudo-SemVer.

This is a library that allows you to centralise this logic and forget about the ugly parts of making HTTP requests.\\\\n\\\\n- [x] 📱 iOS 10.0+\\\\n- [x] 💻 OS X 10.12+\\\\n- [x] ⌚️ watchOS 3.0+\\\\n- [x] 📺 tvOS 10.0+\\\\n\\\\nYet another networking library? Well apart from some unique benefits such as built-in rate limiting and powerful request authentication, a significant benefit for you is that any tagged version has been tested in production. We only tag a new release once it’s been used for two weeks by the Spotify app (which has millions of active users a day). As such you can be sure tagged versions are as stable as possible.\\\\n\\\\nAs for Spotify, we wanted a light networking library that we had full control over in order to act fast in squashing bugs, and carefully select the feature we needed and were capable of supporting. The architecture also plays very nicely into our MVVM and view aggregation service architectures at Spotify by tying the lifetime of a request to the view.\\\\n\\\\n## Architecture :triangular_ruler:\\\\n`SPTDataLoader` is designed as an HTTP stack with 3 additional layers on top of `NSURLSession`.\\\\n\\\\n- **The Application level**, which controls the rate limiting and back-off policies per service, respecting the “Retry-After” header and knowing when or not it should retry the request.\\\\n- **The User level**, which controls the authentication of the HTTP requests.\\\\n- **The View level**, which allows automatic cancellation of requests the view has made upon deallocation.\\\\n\\\\n### Authentication\\\\nThe authentication in this case is abstract, allowing the creator of the SPTDataLoaderFactory to define their own semantics for token acquisition and injection. It allows for asynchronous token acquisition if the token is invalid that seamlessly integrates with the HTTP request-response pattern.\\\\n\\\\n### Back-off policy\\\\nThe data loader service allows rate limiting of URLs to be set explicitly or to be determined by the server using the “Retry-After” semantic. It allows back-off retrying by using a jittered exponential backoff to prevent the thundering hordes creating a request storm after a predictable exponential period has expired.\\\\n\\\\n## Installation :building_construction:\\\\nSPTDataLoader can be installed in a variety of ways, either as a dynamic framework, a static library, or through a dependency manager such as CocoaPods or Carthage.\\\\n\\\\n### Manually\\\\n#### Dynamic Framework\\\\nDrag the [framework](https://github.com/spotify/SPTDataLoader/releases) into the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” area in the “General” section of the target.\\\\n#### Static Library\\\\nDrag `SPTDataLoader.xcodeproj` into your App’s Xcode project and link your app with the library in the “Build Phases” section of the target.\\\\n\\\\n### CocoaPods\\\\nTo integrate SPTDataLoader into your project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), add it to your `Podfile`:\\\\n```ruby\\\\npod \\\\\\'SPTDataLoader\\\\\\', \\\\\\'~> 2.2\\\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Carthage\\\\nTo integrate SPTDataLoader into your project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add it to your `Cartfile`:\\\\n```ogdl\\\\ngithub \"spotify/SPTDataLoader\" ~> 2.2\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Usage example :eyes:\\\\nFor an example of this framework\\\\\\'s usage, see the demo application `SPTDataLoaderDemo` in `SPTDataLoader.xcodeproj`. Just follow the instructions in [`ClientKeys.h`](demo/ClientKeys.h).\\\\n\\\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoaderService\\\\nIn your app you should only have 1 instance of SPTDataLoaderService, ideally you would construct this in something similar to an AppDelegate. It takes in a rate limiter, resolver, user agent and an array of NSURLProtocols. The rate limiter allows objects outside the service to change the rate limiting for different endpoints, the resolver allows overriding of host names, and the array of NSURLProtocols allows support for protocols other than http/s.\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoaderRateLimiter *rateLimiter = [SPTDataLoaderRateLimiter rateLimiterWithDefaultRequestsPerSecond:10.0];\\\\nSPTDataLoaderResolver *resolver = [SPTDataLoaderResolver new];\\\\nself.service = [SPTDataLoaderService dataLoaderServiceWithUserAgent:@\"Spotify-Demo\"\\\\n                                                        rateLimiter:rateLimiter\\\\n                                                           resolver:resolver\\\\n                                           customURLProtocolClasses:nil];\\\\n```\\\\nNote that you can provide all these as nils if you are so inclined, it may be for the best to use nils until you identify a need for these different configuration options.\\\\n\\\\n### Defining your own SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser\\\\nIf you don\\\\\\'t need to authenticate your requests you can skip this. In order to authenticate your requests against a backend, you are required to create an implementation of the SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser, the demo project has an example in its SPTDataLoaderAuthoriserOAuth class. In this example we are checking if the request is for the domain which we are attempting to authenticate for, and then performing the authentication (in this case we are injecting an Auth Token into the HTTP header). This interface is asynchronous to allow you to perform token refreshes while a request is in flight in order to hold it until it is ready to be authenticated. Once you have a valid token you can call the delegate (which in this case will be the factory) in order to inform it that the request has been authenticated. Alternatively if you are unable to authenticate the request tell the delegate about the error.\\\\n\\\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoaderFactory\\\\nYour app should ideally only create an SPTDataLoaderFactory once your user has logged in or if you require no authentication for your calls. The factory controls the authorisation of the different requests against authoriser objects that you construct.\\\\n```objc\\\\nid<SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser> oauthAuthoriser = [[SPTDataLoaderAuthoriserOAuth alloc] initWithDictionary:oauthTokenDictionary];\\\\nself.oauthFactory = [self.service createDataLoaderFactoryWithAuthorisers:@[ oauthAuthoriser ]];\\\\n```\\\\nWhat we are doing here is using an implementation of an authoriser to funnel all the requests created by this factory into these authorisers.\\\\n\\\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoader\\\\nYour app should create an SPTDataLoader object per view that wants to make requests (e.g. it is best not too share these between classes). This is so when your view model is deallocated the requests made by your view model will also be cancelled.\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoader *dataLoader = [self.oauthFactory createDataLoader];\\\\n```\\\\nNote that this data loader will only authorise requests that are made available by the authorisers supplied to its factory.\\\\n\\\\n### Creating the SPTDataLoaderRequest\\\\nIn order to create a request the only information you will need is the URL and where the request came from. For more advanced requests see the properties on SPTDataLoaderRequest which let you change the method, timeouts, retries and whether to stream the results.\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:meURL\\\\n                                                    sourceIdentifier:@\"playlists\"];\\\\n[self.dataLoader performRequest:request];\\\\n```\\\\nAfter you have made the request your data loader will call its delegate regarding results of the requests.\\\\n\\\\n### Handling Streamed Requests\\\\nSometimes you will want to process HTTP requests as they come in packet by packet rather than receive a large callback at the end, this works better for memory and certain forms of media. For Spotify\\\\\\'s purpose, it works for streaming MP3 previews of our songs. An example of using the streaming API:\\\\n```objc\\\\nvoid AudioSampleListener(void *, AudioFileStreamID, AudioFileStreamPropertyID, UInt32 *);\\\\nvoid AudioSampleProcessor(void *, UInt32, UInt32, const void *, AudioStreamPacketDescription *);\\\\n\\\\n- (void)load\\\\n{\\\\n    NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://i.spotify.com/mp3_preview\"];\\\\n    SPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:URL sourceIdentifier:@\"preview\"];\\\\n    request.chunks = YES;\\\\n    [self.dataLoader performRequest:request];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader\\\\ndidReceiveDataChunk:(NSData *)data\\\\n       forResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\\\n{\\\\n    [data enumerateByteRangesUsingBlock:^(const void *bytes, NSRange byteRange, BOOL *stop) {\\\\n        AudioFileStreamParseBytes(_audioFileStream, byteRange.length, bytes, 0);\\\\n    }];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader didReceiveInitialResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\\\n{\\\\n    AudioFileStreamOpen((__bridge void *)self,\\\\n                        AudioSampleListener,\\\\n                        AudioSampleProcessor,\\\\n                        kAudioFileMP3Type,\\\\n                        &_audioFileStream);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (BOOL)dataLoaderShouldSupportChunks:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader\\\\n{\\\\n    return YES;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nBe sure to render YES in your delegate to tell the data loader that you support chunks, and to set the requests chunks property to YES.\\\\n\\\\n### Rate limiting specific endpoints\\\\nIf you specify a rate limiter in your service, you can give it a default requests per second metric which it applies to all requests coming out your app. (See “[Creating the `SPTDataLoaderService`](#creating-the-sptdataloaderservice)”). However, you can also specify rate limits for specific HTTP endpoints, which may be useful if you want to forcefully control the rate at which clients can make requests to a backend that does large amounts of work.\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoaderRateLimiter *rateLimiter = [SPTDataLoaderRateLimiter rateLimiterWithDefaultRequestsPerSecond:10.0];\\\\nNSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.spotify.com/thing/thing\"];\\\\n[rateLimiter setRequestsPerSecond:1 forURL:URL];\\\\n```\\\\nIt should be noted that when you set the requests per second for a URL, it takes the host, and the first component of the URL and rate limits everything that fits that description.\\\\n\\\\n### Switching Hosts for all requests\\\\nThe SPTDataLoaderService takes in a resolver object as one of its arguments. If you choose to make this non-nil, then you can switch the hosts of different requests as they come in. At Spotify we have a number of DNS matches our requests can go through, giving us backups and failsafes in case one of these machines go down. These operations happen in the SPTDataLoaderResolver, where you can specify a number of alternative addresses for the host. An example of Spotify specifying alternative endpoints for its hosts could be:\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoaderResolver *resolver = [SPTDataLoaderResolver new];\\\\nNSArray *alternativeAddresses = @[ @\"spotify.com\",\\\\n                                   @\"backup.spotify.com\",\\\\n                                   @\"backup2.spotify.com\",\\\\n                                   @\"backup3.spotify.com\",\\\\n                                   @\"192.168.0.1\",\\\\n                                   @\"final.spotify.com\" ];\\\\n[resolver setAddresses:alternativeAddresses forHost:@\"spotify.com\"];\\\\n```\\\\nThis allows any request made to spotify.com to use any one of these other addresses (in this order) if spotify.com becomes unreachable.\\\\n\\\\n### Using the jittered exponential timer\\\\nThis library contains a class called SPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer which it uses internally to perform backoffs with retries. The reason it is jittered is to prevent the \"predictable thundering hoardes\" from hammering our services if one of them happens to go down. In order to make use of this class, there are some do\\\\\\'s and don\\\\\\'ts. For example, do not initialise the class like so:\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer *timer = [SPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer exponentialTimerWithInitialTime:0.0\\\\n                                                                                              maxTime:10.0];\\\\nNSTimeInterval backoffTime = 0.0;\\\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {\\\\n    backoffTime = timer.timeIntervalAndCalculateNext;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis will result in the backoffTime remaining at 0. Why? Because 0.0 multiplied by an exponential number is still 0. A good initial time might be 0.5 or 1.0 seconds. You will also notice that the backoffTime will get further away from the raw exponential time the more times you calculate the next interval:\\\\n```objc\\\\nSPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer *timer = [SPTDataLoaderExponentialTimer exponentialTimerWithInitialTime:1.0\\\\n                                                                                              maxTime:1000.0];\\\\nNSTimeInterval backoffTime = 0.0;\\\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {\\\\n    backoffTime = timer.timeIntervalAndCalculateNext;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis will result in a backoffTime that has drifted far away from its vanilla exponential calculation. Why? Because we add a random jitter to the calculations in order to prevent clients from connecting at the same time, in order to spread the load out evenly when experiencing a reconnect storm. The jitter gets greater along with the exponent.\\\\n\\\\n### Consumption observation\\\\nSPTDataLoaderService allows you to add a consumption observer whose purpose is to monitor the data consumption of the service for both uploads and downloads. This object must conform to the SPTDataLoaderConsumptionObserver protocol. This is quite easy considering it is a single method like so:\\\\n```objc\\\\n- (void)load\\\\n{\\\\n    [self.service addConsumptionObserver:self];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)unload\\\\n{\\\\n    [self.service removeConsumptionObserver:self];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)endedRequestWithResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\\\n                 bytesDownloaded:(int)bytesDownloaded\\\\n                   bytesUploaded:(int)bytesUploaded\\\\n{\\\\n    NSLog(@\"Bytes Downloaded: %d\", bytesDownloaded);\\\\n    NSLog(@\"Bytes Uploaded: %d\", bytesUploaded);\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nAlso note that this isn\\\\\\'t just the payload, it also includes the headers.\\\\n\\\\n### Creating a custom authoriser\\\\nThe SPTDataLoader architecture is designed to centralise authentication around the user level (in this case represented by the factory). In order to do that you must inject an authoriser you made yourself into the factory when it is created. An authoriser in most cases will be injecting an Authorisation header into any request it wants to authorise. An example below shows how a standard authoriser might be constructed for an OAuth flow.\\\\n```objc\\\\n@synthesize delegate = _delegate;\\\\n\\\\n- (NSString *)identifier\\\\n{\\\\n    return @\"OAuth\";\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (BOOL)requestRequiresAuthorisation:(SPTDataLoaderRequest *)request\\\\n{\\\\n    // Here we check the hostname to see if it one of the hostnames we authorise against\\\\n    // It is also advisable to check whether we are using HTTPS, if we are not we should not inject our Authorisation\\\\n    // header in order to keep it secret from prying eyes\\\\n    return [request.URL.host isEqualToString:@\"myauth.com\"] && [request.URL.scheme isEqualToString:@\"https\"];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)authoriseRequest:(SPTDataLoaderRequest *)request\\\\n{\\\\n    [request addValue:@\"My Token\" forHeader:@\"Authorization\"];\\\\n    [self.delegate dataLoaderAuthoriser:self authorisedRequest:request];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)requestFailedAuthorisation:(SPTDataLoaderRequest *)request response:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response\\\\n{\\\\n    // This tells us that the server returned a 400 error code indicating that the authorisation did not work\\\\n    // Commonly this means you should attempt to get another authorisation token\\\\n    // Or the response object should be inspected for additional information from the backend\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n- (void)refresh\\\\n{\\\\n    // Forces a refresh of the authorisation token\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nAs you can see all we are doing here is playing with the headers. It should be noted that if you receive an authoriseRequest: call the rest of the request will not execute until you have either sent the delegate a signal telling it the request has been authorised or failed to be authorised.\\\\n\\\\n### Swift overlay\\\\nAdditional APIs that enhance usage within Swift applications are available through the `SPTDataLoaderSwift` library.\\\\n```swift\\\\n// Creating a DataLoader instance\\\\nlet dataLoader = dataLoaderFactory.makeDataLoader(/* optional */responseQueue: myCustomQueue)\\\\n\\\\n// Creating a Request instance -- all functions can be chained\\\\nlet request = dataLoader.request(modelURL, sourceIdentifier: \"model-page\")\\\\n\\\\n// Modifying the request properties\\\\nrequest.modify { request in\\\\n    request.body = modelData\\\\n    request.method = .patch\\\\n    request.addValue(\"application/json\", forHeader: \"Accept\")\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// Adding a response validator\\\\nrequest.validate { response in\\\\n    guard response.statusCode.rawValue == 200 else {\\\\n        throw ValidationError.badStatus(code: response.statusCode.rawValue)\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// Adding a response serializer (and executing the request)\\\\nrequest.responseDecodable { response in\\\\n    modelResultHandler(response.result)\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// Cancelling the request\\\\nrequest.cancel()\\\\n```\\\\nYou can also define serializers to handle custom data types:\\\\n```swift\\\\nstruct ProtobufResponseSerializer<Message: SwiftProtobuf.Message>: ResponseSerializer {\\\\n    func serialize(response: SPTDataLoaderResponse) throws -> Message {\\\\n        guard response.error == nil else {\\\\n            throw response.error.unsafelyUnwrapped\\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\n        guard let data = response.body else {\\\\n            throw ResponseSerializationError.dataNotFound\\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\n        return try Message(serializedData: data)\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nlet modelSerializer = ProtobufResponseSerializer<MyCustomModel>()\\\\nrequest.responseSerializable(serializer: modelSerializer) { response in\\\\n    modelResultHandler(response.result)\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Background story :book:\\\\nAt Spotify we have begun moving to a decentralised HTTP architecture, and in doing so have had some growing pains. Initially we had a data loader that would attempt to refresh the access token whenever it became invalid, but we immediately learned this was very hard to keep track of. We needed some way of injecting this authorisation data automatically into a HTTP request that didn\\\\\\'t require our features to do any more heavy lifting than they were currently doing.\\\\n\\\\nThus we came up with a way to elegantly inject tokens in a Just-in-time manner for requests that require them. We also wanted to learn from our mistakes with our proprietary protocol, and bake in back-off policies early to avoid us DDOSing our own backends with huge amounts of eronious requests.\\\\n\\\\n## Documentation :books:\\\\nSee the [`SPTDataLoader` documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SPTDataLoader) on [CocoaDocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org) for the full documentation.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also add it to [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) if you want to, using the following Dash feed:\\\\n```\\\\ndash-feed://http%3A%2F%2Fcocoadocs.org%2Fdocsets%2FSPTDataLoader%2FSPTDataLoader.xml\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing :mailbox_with_mail:\\\\nContributions are welcomed, have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more information.\\\\n\\\\n## License :memo:\\\\nThe project is available under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'sigma67/spotifyplaylist_to_ytmusic\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"# Transfer a Spotify Playlist to YouTube Music\\\\n\\\\nA simple command line script to clone a Spotify playlist to YouTube Music.\\\\n\\\\n- Transfer a single Spotify playlist\\\\n- Transfer all playlists for a Spotify user\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Python 3.6+ - https://www.python.org\\\\n- Python extensions: `pip install -U -r requirements`\\\\n- Have made at least one playlist manually on YouTube Music\\\\n\\\\n## Setup\\\\n\\\\n1.

The quickest way to get up and running is to use a Jamstack platform like Netlify or GitHub Pages.\\\\n\\\\n* Fork this repository\\\\n* Connect your repo to your Jamstack platform\\\\n* Add your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret to the platforms environment variables\\\\n* Deploy!\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n# How to use\\\\n\\\\n**Prerequisites:**\\\\nYou will need:\\\\n* A GitHub account\\\\n* A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account\\\\n* Spotify Client Keys\\\\n* A device to display Nowify\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Fork this repository\\\\n\\\\nOn this page, click on the \\\\\\'Fork\\\\\\' button in the top-right to create a copy of the repo as-is on your account. Alternatively, you can clone the repo and push to GitHub.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Create a new project on Netlify\\\\nLog in to Netlify and click \\\\\\'New site from Git\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re doing this for the first time, you will need to authorise your GitHub account with Netlify by following the instructions.\\\\n\\\\nOnce authorised, follow the on-screen instructions to connect your repository. You should be fine to leave the default settings here as-is.\\\\n\\\\nClick on \\\\\\'Deploy site\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n_Note: Nowify should use Node 14. This has been set in the project environment. I\\\\\\'ve only ever attempted this Netlify, so cannot help you if you use another platform._\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Create Spotify Client keys.\\\\nTo allow authorisation to your track data, you\\\\\\'ll need to generate Spotify API keys. You can do this by logging in to the [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) creating an app.\\\\n\\\\nCall the application \\\\\\'Nowify\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\nSet the _Redirect URI_ as the URL of your project in Netlify. This must be set else Spotify won\\\\\\'t authorise Nowify.\\\\n\\\\n**Important:** The _Redirect URI_ entered in this field must match the URL of your Netlify site exactly, or you\\\\\\'ll receive authorisation errors. A common issue is that Spotify will automatically add a trailing slash to the URL upon saving. For example: `https://example.netlify.com` vs `https://example.netlify.com/`.\\\\n\\\\nYou can leave the other settings (Callback URL, Bundle IDs etc) blank.\\\\n\\\\nCopy down the Client Secret and Client ID and save your app in the Spotify Dashboard.\\\\n\\\\n### 4. Add the Client ID and Client Secret to Netlify\\\\n\\\\nNow that we have our Spotify API keys, we must let Nowify know that they exist.\\\\n\\\\nTo do this, navigate to Netlify > Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment\\\\n\\\\nUnder _Environment variables_, add two fields. The _Keys_ can be found in the `env.sample` file and the values will be the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nHit save.\\\\n\\\\n### 5. View Nowify\\\\n\\\\nOnce the environment variables are in, you will have to navigate to your Netlify site overview > Deploys > Trigger Deploy drop-down > click \\\\\\'Clear cache and deploy site\\\\\\' and wait for deployment to complete. You can now navigate to your Netlify site. You\\\\\\'ll be prompted with a Spotify login button. Do that, and you\\\\\\'re good to go!\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, you can clone the repo, compile the code offline, and upload to your own webserver (more advanced users only). If you\\\\\\'re considering doing this, I\\\\\\'ll assume that you somewhat know you\\\\\\'re way around build tools.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n### Original Write up:\\\\n[https://ashcroft.dev/blog/now-playing-screen-spotify-raspberry-pi-es6/](https://ashcroft.dev/blog/now-playing-screen-spotify-raspberry-pi-es6/)\\\\n\\\\n### Brief About:\\\\nNowify was a project that I originally made in 2017 when I wanted to learn more modern Javascript. Over the years, I\\\\\\'ve learned a lot more and had people contact me about Nowify, so I wanted to build a more modern version of it using modern tools.

It shows on which of your devices you’re playing the song. If you like you can also display the album cover.\\\\n\\\\nTo be able to display your currently playing song the module must connect to the Spotify service and query your private data. For obvious reasons this is not possible for arbitrary apps – or for that matter MagicMirror modules. There are third party solutions which will enable access to your Spotify data. This module is designed to be independent from third party services. Everything you need is in this module respectively is created by yourself.\\\\n\\\\n## Screenshots\\\\n| ![Screenshot when nothing is playing](img/readme/screenshot_nothing_playing.png) | ![Screenshot of a song playing without cover art](img/readme/screenshot_without_coverart.png) | ![Screenshot of a song playing with cover art](img/readme/screenshot_with_coverart.png) |\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n| Nothing is playing. | A song is playing and `showCoverArt` is set to `false`. | A song is playing and `showCoverArt` is set to `true`. |\\\\n\\\\n## Preconditions\\\\n\\\\n* MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> instance\\\\n* Node.js version >= 7\\\\n* npm\\\\n* a Spotify account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Installing\\\\nInstalling the module is quite straight forward. Getting it to display your playing songs requires a bit more work.\\\\n\\\\n### Step 1 – Install the module\\\\n\\\\nIn your MagicMirror directory: \\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\ncd modules\\\\ngit clone https://github.com/raywo/MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify.git\\\\ncd MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify\\\\nnpm install\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Step 2 – Create and authorise a Spotify app\\\\nIn order to be able to connect to the Spotify API you need to create an app in the [Spotify developer area](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). Then you need to authorise the app to access your personal data. Et voilà!\\\\n\\\\nThe module provides you with a special app which describes all the necessary steps and which guides you through the whole process. To use this app change into the `authorization` folder and start the app by typing `node app`. \\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\ncd authorization\\\\nnode app\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen the app is running you can access it by opening `localhost:8888` in your browser. Provided you are doing this directly on your Raspberry Pi. If you want to access the app remotely just type the ip address or the name of your Raspberry like so for instance: `http://raspi:8888`. Then you should see the authorisation app like below.\\\\n\\\\n|![Screenshot for authorisation app](img/readme/screenshot_authorize_app.png)|\\\\n|---|\\\\n\\\\nNow just follow the steps described there. After successful authorisation the app will display a code snippet under the heading **Step 3: Configure your mirror**. Copy that snippet and paste it into your mirror’s `config.js`. Configure the rest to your needs and you’re good to go.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Updating\\\\n\\\\nGo to the module’s folder inside MagicMirror modules folder and pull the latest version from GitHub and install:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\ngit pull\\\\nnpm install\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Configuring\\\\nThere is not very much to configure but here are the options:\\\\n\\\\n| Option | Description |\\\\n|--------|-------------|\\\\n| `showCoverArt` | <p>A boolean value decribing whether an album cover photo should be displayed or not.</p><p>**Type:** `boolean` **OPTIONAL**<br>**Example:** `false`<br>**Default Value:** `true`</p> |\\\\n| `updatesEvery` | <p>An integer determining the interval for display updates.</p><p>**Type:** `integer` **OPTIONAL**<br>**Example:** `5`<br>**Default Value:** `1`</p><p>**Note:** With the default setting the display is updated every second.

See our standalone tutorials for [setting up the IDE](https://docs.thingpulse.com/how-tos/Arduino-IDE-for-ESP8266/) and [installing the drivers](https://docs.thingpulse.com/how-tos/install-drivers/) if you need help with that.\\\\n\\\\n### Prepare Project in Arduino IDE\\\\n\\\\n1. Download this project either as ZIP file or check it out with Git\\\\n1. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.\\\\n1. Install the required Arduino libraries. Go to Sketch > Include Library... > Manage Libraries.... Then, for each library, put its name into the text field to have its metadata pulled from the internet and displayed below. Select the latest version and install it.\\\\n\\\\t1. [Mini Grafx](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/mini-grafx) library (by ThingPulse, V 1.0.0 or later)\\\\n\\\\t1. [JPEGDecoder](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/jpeg-decoder) library (by Bodmer, Makoto Kurauchi, Rich Geldreich, v1.7.8 or later). After installing the library go to your Arduino sketchbook folder (the one configured in Arduino Preferences > Sketchbook location). In that folder open file `libraries/JPEGDecoder/src/User_config.h` and comment line 5 so that it reads `//#define LOAD_SD_LIBRARY`.\\\\n\\\\t1. [JSON Streaming Parser](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/json-streaming-parser) library (by Daniel Eichhorn, v1.0.5 or later)\\\\n\\\\t1. [ThingPulse XPT2046 Touch](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/thing-pulse-xpt2046-touch) (our fork of the original lib by Paul Stoffregen, v1.2.0 or later)\\\\n1. Set your *WiFi credentials* in the `settings.h` file\\\\n1. Complete the steps below to get the values for the *Spotify settings* required in `settings.h`\\\\n\\\\n### Get Access to the Spotify API\\\\n\\\\n1. Go to [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and login to or sign up for the Spotify Developer Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n2. Click on \"My New App\"\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyDashboard.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n3. Fill out the form. Give your new app a name you can attribute to this project. It\\\\\\'s safe to select \"I don\\\\\\'t know\" for the type of application.\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyAppSignUp1.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n4. At the end of the 3 steps click \"Submit\"\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyppSignUp3.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n5. Set the unique Client ID and Client Secret as values for the respective variables in `settings.h`\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyCredentials.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n6. Click on \"Edit Settings\". Add \"http://esp8266.local/callback/\" to the Redirect URIs section.\\\\n\\\\n   **NOTE** If you\\\\\\'re running more than ThingPulse Spotify Remote in the same WiFi network you should choose a unique name rather than \"esp8266\". Regardless of what you choose it has to reflect what you set as `espotifierNodeName` in `settings.h`\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyAppSettings.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n7. Don\\\\\\'t forget to save your settings.\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyAppSettingsSave.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n### Compile and run the application\\\\n\\\\nAfter all this configuration it\\\\\\'s about time to run the application!\\\\n\\\\n1. First check the configuration in `settings.h` one more time to ensure the Spotify values match those set on the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Better safe than sorry, they say.\\\\n\\\\n2. Attach your [ESP8266 Color Kit](https://thingpulse.com/product/esp8266-wifi-color-display-kit-2-4/) to your computer and select the correct serial port and flash settings in the Arduino IDE as per https://docs.thingpulse.com/guides/wifi-color-display-kit/#select-flash-mode-and-flash-size\\\\n\\\\n3. Upload the code to your ESP8266\\\\n\\\\n4. When you run this the first time you\\\\\\'ll have to go through additional steps. The display will ask you to open the browser at a specific location. This will redirect you to the dialog below.\\\\n<img src=\"./images/SpotifyConnectScreen.png\" width=\"400\">\\\\n\\\\n5. The next step is to calibrate the screen. Click on the white circles\\\\n\\\\n6. Now open your Spotify player and start a song. If everything worked out you\\\\\\'ll see the song information with artwork on the TFT screen!\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'bgveenstra/handlebars-spotify\\', \\'language\\': \\'HTML\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify Search\\\\n\\\\n**Objective:** You\\\\\\'ve been handed a partially-finished music search app using jQuery, AJAX, and the Spotify API. It uses Spotify\\\\\\'s search endpoint to search for tracks (songs).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n![completed app gif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3254910/13961403/b3549c56-f019-11e5-86ad-c1814cf7b6c5.gif)\\\\n\\\\n**In this training, you\\\\\\'ll refactor a music search app to use Handlebars templating.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Project Specifications\\\\n\\\\n1. Create a form to search for tracks (songs). This form needs an input field for the search keyword.\\\\n2. When a user submits the form, there must be an AJAX call to Spotify\\\\\\'s search endpoint. Use the search keyword from the form as the track to search.\\\\n4. On success of the AJAX call, render the search results on the page. Use Handlebars templating. Include at least the track name and artist name for each result.\\\\n5. Each time the user submits the form, clear any previous search results from the view.\\\\n\\\\n## Bonus Ideas\\\\n\\\\nOptionally, challenge yourself to take the project farther!\\\\n\\\\n1. Display a track\\\\\\'s album artwork next to each search result in the view. **Hint:** If you try to access the album artwork but none is available, your app will break. Prevent this from happening with a check to see if any artwork is available first.\\\\n\\\\n2. Spotify gives us a `preview_url` for each track. Create a play button for each track in your view that opens the `preview_url` in a new tab (it will start playing the song!).\\\\n\\\\n3. It would be nice to let the user know something is happening in the few milliseconds between submitting the form and getting data on the page. Show `loading.gif` (provided in the `images` directory) when the form submits, and hide it when you get data back from Spotify.\\\\n\\\\n4. Handle the case where no data comes back from Spotify. You\\\\\\'ll want to let the user know that there are no results, rather than just showing a blank page.\\\\n\\\\n5. Handle the case where the user submits the search with an empty keyword. Check out the error in the console when submitting this form blank; Spotify considers this a \"bad request!\" If the user tries to submit a blank form, don\\\\\\'t search and instead remind them to enter a keyword.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started\\\\n\\\\n1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your class work folder (`wdi`, `devel`, or whichever folder you keep your WDI work in on your local machine). You\\\\\\'ll work in the code from this project\\\\\\'s `starter-code` directory.\\\\n\\\\n2. Practice querying Spotify\\\\\\'s search endpoint using Postman or `curl` with a few different search keywords. Spotify will require that you set `type=track` in your request URL. Look at the response data, and figure out how you would access the track name and artist name for a particular track (this will involve accessing values from JSON with nested objects and arrays).\\\\n\\\\n3. Once you feel comfortable with the structure of the response data, work on using AJAX to make the API call to Spotify when the user submits the form.\\\\n\\\\n4. Start by `console.log`-ing the response data. Once you have that working, access the data you want to display (track name and artist name).\\\\n\\\\n5. One you know how to access the data from the results, use jQuery to `append` it to the page. You might want to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\" target=\"_blank\">Array#forEach</a> to iterate through all the tracks Spotify returns in the response data.\\\\n\\\\n## Resources\\\\n\\\\n* <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery.ajax()</a>\\\\n* <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Search Endpoint</a>\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'saimon24/ionic-spotify-ui\\', \\'language\\': \\'TypeScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Ionic Spotify Player UI - Built with Ionic\\\\n\\\\nComing soon..\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'plamere/BoilTheFrog\\', \\'language\\': \\'HTML\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Boil The Frog\\\\n\\\\nThis is the source for a web app called BoilTheFrog that creates seamless\\\\nSpotify playlists between any two artists.

There are two python scripts that gather this data:\\\\n \\\\n* crawl_graph.py - crawls the artist similarity data. It takes 12 to 24 hours to crawl the data for about 100 to 150K artists.\\\\n \\\\n* sp_songs.py - crawls the top songs for each artist from Spotify. This takes about 12 hours to run.\\\\n\\\\nThe output data from these two scripts are loaded by the server and used to build a graph (via networkx) that is used to satisfy the find_path requests.\\\\n\\\\nThe server relies on cherrypy and networkx.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# The Web App\\\\nThe web app is a relatively simple app that solicits artist names from the user, calls the find_path method on the server to get the path and displays the path to the user. The web audio api is used to manage playback.  The playlist can be saved to Spotify if the user allows it. The authentication code is based on this [example](https://github.com/possan/playlistcreator-example). \\\\n\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'pwittchen/tmux-plugin-spotify\\', \\'language\\': \\'Shell\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"# tmux-plugin-spotify\\\\ntmux plugin displaying currently played song on Spotify\\\\n\\\\n**Note**: currently it works on Linux only!\\\\n\\\\nRequirements\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nIn order to use this plugin, you need to install [spotify-cli-linux](https://github.com/pwittchen/spotify-cli-linux) program.\\\\n\\\\nYou can do it with the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npip install spotify-cli-linux\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n------------\\\\n### Installation with [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)\\\\n\\\\nAdd plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nset -g @plugin \\'pwittchen/tmux-plugin-spotify\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it.\\\\n\\\\nIf format strings are added to `status-right`, they should now be visible.\\\\n\\\\nUsage\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIn order to see currently played Spotify song via this tmux plugin, add the following command to your `.tmux.conf` file:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n#{spotify_song}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can also set more options like:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n#{spotify_status_full}, #{spotify_status}, #{spotify_song}, #{spotify_artist}, #{spotify_album}, #{spotify_playback}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAvailable Options\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\n- spotify_status\\\\n- spotify_status_full\\\\n- spotify_song\\\\n- spotify_song_full\\\\n- spotify_artist\\\\n- spotify_artist_full\\\\n- spotify_album\\\\n- spotify_playback\\\\n\\\\nReferences\\\\n----------\\\\n- https://github.com/tmux-plugins\\\\n- https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-example-plugin\\\\n- https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-battery\\\\n- https://github.com/pwittchen/dotfiles\\\\n- https://github.com/pwittchen/spotify-cli-linux\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'regisb/spotify-onthego\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'-----------------\\\\nSpotify On The Go\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nDownload songs and playlist from Spotify.

By connecting the client to the server with WebSockets, the server will handle all of the polling and diffing, and the client will simply be notified whenever there is a change to the state of the player. This makes the client side code a lot cleaner and simpler.\\\\n\\\\nIt should be noted that this project does not fully solve the problems discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/492), in that there is still polling taking place (one request per second right now) and therefore hitting rate limits is a possibility. If you do hit the rate limit using this plugin, please let me know how many concurrent users caused it, because I would like to integrate functionality that automatically throttles the poll rate based on the number of concurrent websocket connections.\\\\n\\\\n### Usage\\\\n\\\\nThis package has been developed to work with an Express + Socket.IO server environment.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to skip the server setup and go straight to working with your app, use this testing url in the meantime: https://spotify-connect-ws.herokuapp.com/connect\\\\n\\\\n#### Examples\\\\n\\\\nI have made a couple of example projects that show how your server and client apps might look when using this package.\\\\n\\\\nClient (React.js): https://github.com/lrholmes/spotify-connect-ws-react-example\\\\n\\\\nServer: https://github.com/lrholmes/spotify-connect-ws-server-example\\\\n\\\\nServer:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nnpm install spotify-connect-ws --save\\\\n# or\\\\nyarn add spotify-connect-ws\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport express from \\'express\\'\\\\nimport socketio from \\'socket.io\\'\\\\nimport connectSocket from \\'spotify-connect-ws\\'\\\\n\\\\nconst app = express()\\\\nconst server = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3001)\\\\n\\\\nconst io = socketio(server)\\\\nio.of(\\'connect\\').on(\\'connection\\', connectSocket)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nClient:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nnpm install socket.io-client --save\\\\n# or\\\\nyarn add socket.io-client\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport openSocket from \\'socket.io-client\\'\\\\nconst io = openSocket(\\'/connect\\')\\\\n// or if using testing url\\\\nconst io = openSocket(\\'https://spotify-connect-ws.herokuapp.com/connect\\')\\\\n\\\\nio.emit(\\'initiate\\', { accessToken: \\'access token\\' })\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### How it works\\\\n\\\\nTo start watching the player for changes, use `io.emit(\\'initiate\\', { accessToken })`. If successful, the first event receieved by the client, named `initial_state` will provide the full Player object from Spotify. You should use this to set up any views or state needed for your app. After this event, your client will receive events based on changes to the Player\\'s state (e.g. playback paused, track changed). All of these events are listed below.\\\\n\\\\n### Events\\\\n\\\\n#### Received Events\\\\n\\\\nThese events are used in combination with `on()` to receive changes to the player state.\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nio.on(\\'track_change\\', track => {\\\\n  // update state/store with new track\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n`initial_state`: This event is received once, after initiating the connection. It contains the full Player object.\\\\n\\\\n`connect_error`: Any errors encountered on the server will be sent back to the client here.\\\\n\\\\n`track_change`: Received after a track change is detected, along with the Spotify Track object for the new track.\\\\n\\\\n`playback_started`: Indicates playback starting (both when a new track starts and when a paused track resumes playback)\\\\n\\\\n`playback_paused`\\\\n\\\\n`device_change`: A change to the active playback device has occured. The new Device is sent back with this event.\\\\n\\\\n`volume_change`: Volume has been changed - the volume percent is sent back.\\\\n\\\\n`track_end`: The current track has ended. This event is detected on the serverside by checking if the track is has less than two seconds of playback remaining. This is reliable in my testing, but there is probably a better way of checking for track end.\\\\n\\\\n#### Sent Events\\\\n\\\\nThese are used to trigger playback events.\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nio.emit(\\'play\\', { id: \\'5Y17vKO1JtfnxIlM4vNQT6\\' })\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n`initiate`: Accepts an object with required `accessToken` parameter. This event begins watching the player state and is required before using any of the other events.\\\\n\\\\n`play`: This event accepts an optional object representing the parameters for the Connect API (`uris`, `context_uri`, `offset`), but additionally accepts `id`, representing a Spotify Track ID, that will play that track. If no object is provided, the server will attempt to `resume` playback.\\\\n\\\\n`resume`: Resume playback.\\\\n\\\\n`pause`: Pause playback.\\\\n\\\\n`seek`: Seek to position provided as argument (target position in milliseconds).\\\\n\\\\n`next_track`: Skip to next track in queue\\\\n\\\\n`previous_track`: Go to previous track in play history\\\\n\\\\n`set_volume`: Set volume to integer representing percentage provided as argument\\\\n\\\\n`transfer_playback`: Transfer playback to another device, accepts an object with following params: `id`, the device ID, and `play`, which defaults to `false` but if `true` will force playback on the new device.\\\\n\\\\n`access_token`: This will set the socket\\'s access token. If you are refreshing your token, ensure to send this event after.\\\\n\\\\n### Contributing\\\\n\\\\nPlease contribute with any changes or fixes you\\'d like to see! Especially if you have any experience with Socket.IO, I\\'m sure that I\\'ve probably made some mistakes here or there.\\\\n\\\\nSome things that I would like to add soon:\\\\n\\\\n* The rest of the Player options (shuffle, repeat)\\\\n* Tests\\\\n* The ability to manage devices (events for new devices detected)\\\\n\\\\nLonger term, it might be possible to dynamically adjust the poll time when there are more users connected, but first we\\'ll need to know at what point rate limits become an issue.\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'GMCtree/Spotify-Bot\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify Bot\\\\n\\\\n***NOTE: The bot is currently hosted on Heroku***\\\\n\\\\n## Table of Contents\\\\n[Introduction](#intro)  \\\\n[Usage](#use)  \\\\n[Running the Bot](#run)  \\\\n  * [Local](#local)\\\\n  * [Heroku](#heroku)  \\\\n  \\\\n[Running the Unit Tests](#tests)\\\\n\\\\n<a id = \"intro\"></a>\\\\n## Introduction\\\\nThis is a Telegram bot that has the ability to make calls to the Spotify API to satisfy user requests. This bot is wrtten in Python and is being developed with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) provided by the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) team. The documentation for the API that I used is located [here](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)\\\\n\\\\n<a id = \"use\"></a>\\\\n## Usage\\\\nTo use the bot, you will first need to create a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account. Once you do that, you can call the bot from anywhere by calling the bot with @spotify_telegram_bot.\\\\n\\\\nTo make a search, call the bot and type. The bot will respond with an option to grab the top result of either a track, artist, album or playlist and you can click which you would like to get a Spotify link to the item.\\\\n\\\\n<a id = \"run\"></a>\\\\n## Running the Bot\\\\n<a id = \"local\"></a>\\\\n### Local\\\\nTo run the bot on your local machine, go into the config.json file and switch the \"prod\" value to \"false\". Then, you can run the bot just by typing the following:\\\\n```\\\\npython3 spotify_bot.py\\\\n```\\\\nAfter that, the bot should be running and will receive requests as long as it is running.\\\\n\\\\n<a id = \"heroku\"></a>\\\\n### Heroku\\\\nTo run the bot locally using Heroku, create a .env file using the format KEY=VALUE, where KEY is the key to access the VALUE, and the VALUE is you Telegram API key. You should also follow the same format for your Spotify Developer client ID and client secret keys.\\\\nExample:\\\\n```\\\\nTELEGRAM_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY\\\\nCLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\\\\nCLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can then access this value by using:\\\\n```\\\\nos.environ[\"TELEGRAM_KEY\"]\\\\nos.environ[\"CLIENT_ID\"]\\\\nos.environ[\"CLIENT_SECRET\"]\\\\n```\\\\nTo run the bot, just type:\\\\n```\\\\nheroku local\\\\n```\\\\nAnd then the bot will accept requests.\\\\n\\\\nTo host the bot on Heroku, first create a free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). After doing that, follow the instructions to set up your bot on your Heroku repo. After doing that, go to your config variables in Heroku (located under \\\\\\'Settings\\\\\\') and make sure to add the environment variables that you created in your .env file to here as well. If the bot ran correctly using Heroku locally, then it should run fine when hosted.\\\\n\\\\n<a id = \"tests\"></a>\\\\n## Running the Unit Tests\\\\nThe unit tests have been written using the Python 3 `unittest` library. To run the unit tests, run the following in your terminal:\\\\n```\\\\npython3 tests.py\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will run the unit tests and will let you know if all of them passed or not. If you would like more visibility into which tests pass and which ones did not, run the tests with the `-v` argument like so:\\\\n```\\\\npython3 tests.py -v\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will tell you the results of each of the tests individually as opposed to only telling you if all of them passed or not.\\\\n\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'esenliyim/sp-tray\\', \\'language\\': \\'JavaScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# sp-tray\\\\n\\\\nsp-tray is a very simple GNOME Shell extension that displays current track information in the system tray using Spotify\\\\\\'s dbus interface without using the web API.

Easily transfer all your local songs over to a playlist on Spotify in just a few minutes. Migrating your local library has never been easier!\\\\n\\\\n## Before you start (5 minutes)\\\\n\\\\n*This isn\\\\\\'t infalible, and it would be quite surprising if it matched 100% of songs. Be aware you\\\\\\'ll probably have to do **a bit** of manual searching, but this will significantly reduce that amount by automating the majority of the process.*\\\\n\\\\nOn to the requirements and instructions:\\\\n\\\\n### Install Python >3.6\\\\n\\\\nMake sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed, preferably the latest version. We tested it with Python 3.8.4 on a x64 PC with Windows 10\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll need to install the libraries `spotipy` and `eyed3`\\\\n\\\\nI suggest you create a virtual environment so you don\\\\\\'t mess other libraries, with the built in `venv`\\\\n\\\\n### Using venv (OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED)\\\\n\\\\nFor this, simply open a Terminal in the folder that the code is in (type \\\\\\'wt\\\\\\' in the Windows Explorer address bar for Windows Terminal, or \\\\\\'cmd\\\\\\' if that doesn\\\\\\'t work)\\\\nand write the following commands (make sure to change <MyEnv> for your desired folder name):\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\\\\npython -m venv <MyEnv>\\\\n<MyEnv>\\\\\\\\Scripts\\\\\\\\activate.bat # <- on cmd\\\\n<MyEnv>\\\\\\\\Scripts\\\\\\\\Activate.ps1 # <- on PowerShell\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis should make the terminal look something like this:\\\\n\\\\n![Terminal with venv active](https://imgur.com/1jWhGhU.png)\\\\n\\\\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` and press Enter. It is not necessary, though, as we\\\\\\'ll be working within the environment and you can just close the console once it is done.\\\\n\\\\n### Installing the libraries\\\\n\\\\nYou can now install `spotipy`, `tinytag` and `eyed3` with:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\npip install -r .\\\\\\\\requirements.txt\\\\n```\\\\nor\\\\n```python\\\\npip install --upgrade spotipy\\\\npip install -U eyed3\\\\npip install -U tinytag\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Creating a Spotify Developer Application\\\\n\\\\nHead over to [the Spotify Developer website](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), log in with your Spotify account and create a new application (name doesn\\\\\\'t matter).\\\\n\\\\nCopy the `client id` and the `client secret`, open the settings and make sure to add a URL to the \"Redirect URIs\". It doesn\\\\\\'t really matter what, try https://localhost/ if not sure, but take note of it because you\\\\\\'ll need to write it in the source code later.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lwFiRh9.png)\\\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OerZP5c.jpg)\\\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z3DIPZf.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nWith these 3, open the file `main.py` with whatever IDE or Text Editor you like (preferably Notepad++, Wordpad or TextEdit if you use a text editor), and change this bit of code:\\\\n\\\\n![connect_to_spotify code](https://imgur.com/ltblD1T.png)\\\\n\\\\n(Use the Find function to find it if you don\\\\\\'t see it. It is inside the `connect_to_spotify` function)\\\\n\\\\nPaste the aforementioned ids and the URL you chose in the corresponding lines. With this, setup is done and you can now use the tool!\\\\n\\\\n## Using SpotifyMatcher\\\\n\\\\nUsage is very, very simple. You only have to call the program from a Terminal of your choice with\\\\n```\\\\npython ./main.py username playlist_id\\\\n```\\\\n(may have to use `python3` if you have several versions of Python installed or if you\\\\\\'re not on Windows).\\\\n\\\\nWith this, the application should open a new tab on your default browser. Accept the permissions it asks for, and copy the URL of the page it takes you to (if it\\\\\\'s localhost, it will probably not load anything, that\\\\\\'s perfectly ok. We only need the URL). Paste it in the terminal.\\\\n\\\\nWith that, authentication should be done and you can move on to the *good stuff*. Simply paste the path to your music directory (Tip: right click the address bar on Windows Explorer, \\\\\\'Copy address as text\\\\\\'). **You can also bypass this step** if you manually enter a path in the source code. Simply find the `music_dir` variable and paste it there before you execute the program:\\\\n\\\\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/mZGFs6d.png)\\\\n\\\\nIf the path is valid, the program should start identifying your files and subsequently searching Spotify for a match. This may take several minutes, depending on your processor, internet speed, number of files... Just be patient!\\\\n\\\\nOnce done, if you specified a `playlist_id` it will try to add the matches to said playlist.\\\\n#### ***CAREFUL***\\\\nIf you don\\\\\\'t own said playlist, can\\\\\\'t add tracks or it has been deleted, **the program will fail, and you\\\\\\'ll have to start again**, so make sure you have said permissions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend either leaving it blank, so the program creates a new one for you or creating a new playlist and getting its id (simply open it in the browser and copy the final string of numbers and letters).\\\\n\\\\nOnly thing left is to check the .txt file with the failed matches and search those manually (I know, I know... blame Spotify\\\\\\'s inconsistent artist - title debacle!)\\\\n\\\\n## Getting your username and playlist ids\\\\n### Username\\\\nOpen Spotify on PC, go to your user profile and click the 3 dots. Click share and \"Copy Spotify URI\". Paste and remove the `spotify:user:`\\\\n\\\\n![](https://imgur.com/TS6ZZlV.png)\\\\n\\\\nYou can also copy your profile link and just take the stuff after `/user` but before the `?`\\\\n\\\\n### Playlist id\\\\nWe recommend you don\\\\\\'t actually use a playlist id and rather leave it blank so the program creates one for you automatically, but if you insist, simply open the playlist, click the 3 dots > Share > Copy Spotify URI. As with the username, remove the `spotify:playlist:`.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, you can simply copy the playlist link and just take the final string of numbers and letters.

The songs from your temporary playlist are saved into a permanent playlist, using the Spotify API ([Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow)). The automation is powered by [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and executes automatically on Mondays as defined in the [save.yaml](/.github/workflows/save.yaml).\\\\n\\\\n## Initial Set Up (approx: 10 minutes)\\\\nYou should not need to make any commits back to the repo. The files in [/setup](/setup) will help obtain the authorization information for setting up the environment variables in github secrets in order to allow `main.py` to execute properly. You need to fork this repo in order to have your own instance of github actions.\\\\n\\\\n### (1) Create a Fork\\\\nStart off with simple fork by clicking on the \"Fork\" button. Once you\\\\\\'ve done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or use the command line:\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Clone your fork to your local machine\\\\n$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spotify-save-discover-weekly.git\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### (2) Librairies\\\\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all of the required librairies. You could use this with a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) if required. \\\\n```bash\\\\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### (3) Spotify API Credentials\\\\n1. Open the `.sample.env` file from the [/setup](/setup) folder on your local machine. \\\\n2. Sign into your [Spotify API Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new application. You can use any uri for the redirect uri, this is the base uri you will be redirected to after authorizing the app to access your account. If you see a \"INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI\", then edit settings of your app from the spotify dashboard and add your uri as a redirect uri.\\\\n3. Fill out the env file with the same Client ID, Secret and Redirect URI details used in step 2 and save this file as `.env`. **Do not post these details anywhere publically.**\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n```\\\\nCLIENT_ID=thisisanid\\\\nCLIENT_SECRET=thisisasecret\\\\nREDIRECT_URI=https://your.url/here\\\\n```\\\\n5. Execute [authorization.py](/setup/authorization.py) and open the URL generated. \\\\n6. Authorize your app to access your Spotify account, this will then redirect you to your Redirect URI with a `?code=` parameter in the url.\\\\n7. Copy the whole url you were redirected to into the console and hit enter, this will then give you your refresh token. **Do not post this refresh token anywhere publically.**\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n ```\\\\n$python authorization.py\\\\nOpen this link in your browser: https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=thisisanid&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRegsonDR&scope=user-library-read+playlist-modify-public+playlist-modify-private+playlist-read-private+playlist-read-collaborative\\\\n\\\\nEnter URL you was redirected to (after accepting authorization):\\\\n> https://your.url/here?code=somecodehere\\\\n\\\\nYour refresh token is: somerefreshtokenhere\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### (4) Github Actions\\\\n1. Go to the settings of your forked repo and click on secrets. \\\\n2. You will need to create the following secrets:\\\\n  *  **CLIENT_ID** - Use the same Client ID from your `.env`.\\\\n  *  **CLIENT_SECRET** - Use the same Client Secret from your `.env`\\\\n  *  **REFRESH_TOKEN** - Use the refresh token generated in the [(3) Spotify API Credentials](#3-spotify-api-credentials) instructions above.\\\\n  *  **DISCOVER_WEEKLY_ID** - This is the ID of your Discover Weekly playlist, which can obtained using the [method](#obtaining-spotify-playlist-ids) described below.\\\\n  *  **SAVE_TO_ID** - This is the ID of your permanent playlist, which can be obtained using the [method](#obtaining-spotify-playlist-ids) described below. You will need to create a new playlist or use an existing playlist if there is somewhere you would like to already save the songs into.\\\\n\\\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32569720/113211160-0a7d3380-926d-11eb-97bc-0e17ef911336.png)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n#### Obtaining Spotify Playlist IDs\\\\n1. Right click on a playlist > \"Share\" > Copy the Spotify URI (`spotify:playlist:c11M5VLWLMh66yW4gsl51S`). \\\\n2. The ID is of this playlist is `c11M5VLWLMh66yW4gsl51S`, use this for the environment variable.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Manual Execution via Github Actions\\\\n1. Go to Actions in your forked repo.\\\\n2. Click on \"Save songs\"\\\\n3. Click on \"Run workflow\" which will bring up a drop down menu.\\\\n4. Click on \"Run Workflow\" again, this will initiate the script. Within the next few minutes, the script should execute and your songs should be in your new playlist in spotify.\\\\n\\\\nAny execution errors can be found from within the actions tab of your forked repo.\\\\n\\\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32569720/113211386-4fa16580-926d-11eb-94c9-ddb513a122a7.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Local Execution \\\\nAlternatively, you can store the **REFRESH_TOKEN**, **DISCOVER_WEEKLY_ID** & **SAVE_TO_ID** back into your `.env` file and execute `main.py` on your machine when required, maybe manually or using a task schedular. Make sure to have the `.env` and `main.py` files in the same directory for this.\\\\n\\\\n ```\\\\n$python main.py\\\\n```\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing\\\\nPull requests are welcome.

It\\\\\\'ll need to be running\\\\n**OSX, with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed**. It\\\\\\'ll also need **Ruby**, which comes\\\\npre-installed with OSX, so you should be good there. Lastly, but most importantly, this computer\\\\nis the one that will be playing the music, so it\\\\\\'ll either need\\\\n**good speakers, or a headphone jack** to plug a sound system into.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\\\\\'ve got a computer to run it on, you can install Maestro by running the following commands\\\\nin a terminal:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nbrew install shpotify\\\\n\\\\ngit clone https://github.com/smashingboxes/maestro.git\\\\ncd maestro\\\\nbundle install\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Connecting to Spotify\\\\\\'s api\\\\n\\\\nshpotify needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by\\\\nname. It is very likely you want this feature!\\\\n\\\\nTo get this to work, you first need to sign up (or into) Spotify’s\\\\ndeveloper site and [create an *Application*][spotify-dev]. Once you’ve\\\\ndone so, you can find its `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values and\\\\nenter them into your shpotify config file at `${HOME}/.shpotify.cfg`.\\\\n\\\\nBe sure to quote your values and don’t add any extra spaces. When\\\\ndone, it should look like the following (but with your own values):\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nCLIENT_ID=\"abc01de2fghijk345lmnop\"\\\\nCLIENT_SECRET=\"qr6stu789vwxyz\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nruby app.rb\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will start up Maestro on port 4567. To use it with Slack, you\\\\\\'ll want to configure an external\\\\nURL (see \"Obtaining an external URL\" below), and set up a slash command (see \"Creating a slash\\\\ncommand\" below).\\\\n\\\\nOnce that\\\\\\'s done, you can interact with it via any command\\\\n[shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) supports. Here are the most common commands:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/maestro play <song name>\\\\n/maestro next\\\\n/maestro vol up\\\\n/maestro vol down\\\\n/maestro status\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Configuring Slack\\\\n\\\\n### Obtaining an external URL\\\\n\\\\nThere are many ways to get an external URL or static IP. The easiest is to use [ngrok]():\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nbrew cask install ngrok\\\\nngrok http 4567\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn the output, ngrok will provide you with an external url such as `http://71ca42f4.ngrok.io`,\\\\nyou\\\\\\'ll need that for the next section.\\\\n\\\\n**NOTE: If ngrok gets restarted (during a computer restart, for example), a new URL will be\\\\ngenerated. You\\\\\\'ll need to update your slash command (created in the next section) with the\\\\nnew one.**\\\\n\\\\n### Creating a slash command\\\\n\\\\nTo create a slash command in Slack, go to https://slack.com/apps/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands, click \"Add Configuration\", and fill in the following settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Command: \"/maestro\"\\\\n- URL: Your external URL (from previous section), followed by `/maestro`. So, for example, if your ngrok url is `http://71ca42f4.ngrok.io`, you\\\\\\'d enter `http://71ca42f4.ngrok.io/maestro`\\\\n- Method: POST\\\\n- Customize Name: Maestro\\\\n- Customize Icon: Any icon you\\\\\\'d like.

In this classification the \\\\n[sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) implementations of \\\\n[logistic regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) and \\\\n[random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) are used alongside [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\\\\nto classify if a track should be considered to be added to the set of favourite playlists.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the traditional approach can yield good recommendations, it is heavily reliant on both feature engineering \\\\nand there being enough features which cover user tastes (which is unlikely for subjective items such as movies and songs).\\\\nAs this approach reliant on users define their favourites (classification) or to accurately score songs \\\\n(regression), it suffers from both mislabelling inaccuracies and the cold-start problem when a user has a fresh account \\\\nor doesn\\\\\\'t provide any ratings. Hence recommender system approaches are applied in [recommender_systems.ipynb](recommender_systems.ipynb).\\\\n\\\\n### Model Evaluation Metric\\\\n\\\\nHere we use the Top-N accuracy metric (in this case Top-100), which applies a recommender system to a dataset of 1 user \\\\ninteracted item and 100 uninteracted items. The perfect recommender system will rank the user interacted item first \\\\n(highest recommendation strength). This is computed for each item for each user, and then the weighted mean is taken\\\\nacross all users to get a global metric. The metric \\\\\\'recall@5\\\\\\' for each user is the number of times the interacted item\\\\nwas in the Top-5 items / the number of times it wasn\\\\\\'t.\\\\n\\\\n### Popularity Recommender\\\\n\\\\nA popularity recommender recommends songs ranked by their popularity regardless of user\\\\\\'s preferences. This is of course\\\\ndependent upon the methodology used to determine the popularity metric (usually some function of time, user interactions,\\\\nand user ratings).\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\\\'recall@5\\\\\\': 0.09318497913769123, \\\\\\'recall@10\\\\\\': 0.17385257301808066```\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/popularity.png\" alt=\"popularity\" width=\"500\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\nAs it doesn\\\\\\'t take user activity into account, solely recommending by popularity is a poor way to \\\\nrecommend tracks. However, as we will see later it is a good method to mix in for variety and to avoid the cold-start problem.\\\\n\\\\n### Content-based Recommender\\\\n\\\\nA content-based recommender leverages attributes from items the user has interacted with to recommend similar items. \\\\nHere the popular [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) method is used to convert unstructured text \\\\n(unigrams and bigrams of genres and song/artist/album/playlist name) into a sparse matrix , \\\\nwhich is then summed and normalized across users to give a vector structure, where each word is represented\\\\nby a position in the vector and the value measures its relevance. The cosine similarity between the \\\\nuser vector and the initial matrix (all users) then gives a metric to recommend new tracks.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/tfidf_tokens.png\" alt=\"tfidf_tokens\" width=\"150\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\\\'recall@5\\\\\\': 0.9123783031988874, \\\\\\'recall@10\\\\\\': 0.972183588317107```\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/content.png\" alt=\"content\" width=\"500\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\nA very high recall is observed as the dataset used considers each playlist (which tend to be heavily genre/mood based)\\\\nas a user. Hence the content-based recommender performs exceedingly well by the Top-N metric but fails to give much variety.\\\\n\\\\n### Collaborative Recommender\\\\n\\\\nA collaborative recommender can be either memory-based (based on past user interactions) or model-based (e.g. clustering).\\\\nHere [matrix factorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)) implemented\\\\nvia [singular value decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) is used to compress\\\\na user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation. This yields better scalability and better generalisation.\\\\nThe items x users matrix is then used to recommend items to users based on similar user interactions.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/matrix_factorisation.png\" alt=\"matrix_factorisation\" width=\"400\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\\\'recall@5\\\\\\': 0.23783031988873435, \\\\\\'recall@10\\\\\\': 0.30737134909596664```\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/collaborative.png\" alt=\"collaborative\" width=\"500\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\nThe collaborative approach outperforms the popularity approach but is not a good as the content-based approach. It can \\\\nsuffer from the sparsity problem if the user set is too small or the number of interactions is too low.\\\\n\\\\n### Hybrid Recommender\\\\n\\\\nA hybrid recommender combines the content-based and collaborative approaches and has been shown to perform better in \\\\nmany studies. It avoids high variance and enables variety and weighting (e.g. genre weighting). As the content-based\\\\napproach performs better by the Top-N metric is is weighed more strongly here.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\\\'recall@5\\\\\\': 0.9068150208623088, \\\\\\'recall@10\\\\\\': 0.9666203059805285```\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/hybrid.png\" alt=\"hybrid\" width=\"500\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\nThis weighting approach has the same issue as the content-based recommender - too much weighting on genre and not\\\\nenough variety. Here the popularity approach is also now incorporated with a weighting to give a hybrid + popularity recommender. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\\\'recall@5\\\\\\': 0.6244784422809457, \\\\\\'recall@10\\\\\\': 0.7343532684283728```\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\"left\">\\\\n    <img src=\"results/hybrid_popularity.png\" alt=\"hybrid_popularity\" width=\"500\"/>  \\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\nEven though it has a lower recall, subjectively this recommender appears to give the best recommendations in practice.\\\\nIt may therefore be better to incorporate other evaluation metrics such as one that measures variety, \\\\nor increase the scope of this dataset as its current playlist based approach means that pure genre-based \\\\nrecommendations perform the best.\\\\n\\\\n### Future Work\\\\n\\\\n- Expand the dataset to include other users (rather than proxying playlists as users)\\\\n- Develop other evaluation metrics (although this is somewhat solved by expanding the dataset)\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started\\\\n\\\\n1.

I work at Spotify, and the company has very graciously allowed me to use their graphics and logos. However, these are NOT covered under the BSD license that the code is under, and are NOT included in this repository - a build script will download them separately. Distribution of the graphics contained in Viva is strictly prohibited.\\\\n\\\\n## What Viva Is ##\\\\n\\\\nViva is a Spotify client for Mac OS X Lion. Both building and running require Mac OS X 10.7. Viva is built entirely on Spotify\\\\\\'s libspotify C library.\\\\n\\\\nThis client\\\\\\'s purpose in life is to be a showcase of the Spotify platform as well as a playground for experimenting with ideas and new APIs. It\\\\\\'s very rough around the edges, and even whole views are blank.\\\\n\\\\nSome features:\\\\n\\\\n- Nice playback experience (gapless playback, EQ).\\\\n- Support for playing \"local files\" (MP3, M4A, Apple Lossless, FLAC).\\\\n- Last.fm scrobbling.\\\\n\\\\n## What Viva Is NOT ##\\\\n\\\\nViva is NOT intended to be a replacement Spotify desktop client. It\\\\\\'s missing many features which make it generally unsuitable for sole use. While this will be improved over time, it\\\\\\'s not a priority. Issues filed against Viva along the lines of \"It doesn\\\\\\'t do [feature in desktop client]\" will likely be closed.\\\\n\\\\nThe target audience of Viva is developers - please keep that in mind. In addition, Viva **requires** a Spotify Premium account - this requirement will never change. If you wish to build Viva from source, you also need a libspotify developer key, which can be requested from here: http://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/overview/\\\\n\\\\n## Downloading ##\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'d like to download Viva without building, you\\\\\\'ll find periodic snapshot builds in the Downloads section of the repository\\\\\\'s home on GitHub. You don\\\\\\'t need an appkey to use these, but you still need a Spotify Premium account.\\\\n\\\\n## Building ##\\\\n\\\\n1. Clone Viva using `git clone --recursive git://github.com/iKenndac/Viva.git` to make sure you get all the submodules too.\\\\n2. If you got excited and cloned the repo before reading this, run `git submodule update --init` in the Viva directory to grab the submodules. If I get tickets about it not building and you haven\\\\\\'t got the submodules checked out, you lose 5 internet points!\\\\n3. Supply an appkey.c file (see above).\\\\n4. Build away!\\\\n\\\\n## Interesting Areas ##\\\\n\\\\nViva has been made in my hackday and spare time, which has resulting in the code being rather... scattered. However, there are some nice examples of various Mac OS X technologies in there. A few of my favourites:\\\\n\\\\nCore Data over multiple threads: `LocalFileSource.m`.\\\\n\\\\nCore Audio Graphs, including a Graphic EQ: `SPCoreAudioController.m`.\\\\n\\\\nUsing AVFoundation to get media file metadata: `LocalFileSource.m`, `-parseMediaFileAtPath:intoContext:`.\\\\n\\\\nUsing AVFoundation to convert audio files to PCM data for manual playback through Core Audio: `VivaAVAssetDecoderWorker.m`.\\\\n\\\\nUsing FSEvents to watch a directory tree for changes: `LocalFileSource.m`.\\\\n\\\\nUsing libFLAC to get FLAC metadata: `LocalFileSource+LocalFileSourceFLACAdditions.m`.\\\\n\\\\nUsing libFLAC to decode FLAC files for playback: `VivaFLACDecoderWorker.m`.\\\\n\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'anesthetiize/SpotifyHosts\\', \\'language\\': \\'PowerShell\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# SpotifyHosts\\\\n\\\\n>Please note that this script is no longer maintained.\\\\n>If you encounter a problem, feel free to raise an issue but expect delayed responses.\\\\n\\\\n>Linux script: https://github.com/danilotat/SpotifyHosts. \\\\n>Thanks to danilotat for the bash port.\\\\n\\\\nRequirements: \\\\n\\\\n1. Being logged in as an administrator.\\\\n2. Have the Execution-Policy set to unrestricted in order to run scripts. (Detailed steps below)\\\\n3. Internet Access.\\\\n4. Have the Spotify Windows client installed.\\\\n5. [Optional but recomended] Have a logged in account in the Spotify client.\\\\n6. Have the Spotify client closed.\\\\n\\\\nHow to use it:\\\\n\\\\n1. (Set Execution-Policy) Open a powershell window as administrator and type the following: \\\\n\\\\n           Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted\\\\n\\\\n  Hit enter, type \"A\" (Without the quotation marks) and hit enter again. Now you can close the powershell window.\\\\n\\\\n2. Download the \"Remove-Spotify-Ads.ps1\" File to your computer.\\\\n3. Right click on it, and select \"Run with powershell\".\\\\n4. Accept the Admin prompt.\\\\n\\\\nKnown Issues:\\\\n\\\\n1. The script will most likely fail (red words in the blue window) if you try to run it again because of a specific File being renamed, so when ran again, the script will try to rename a file that no longer exists.\\\\n2. If you\\\\\\'re logged in, into a not-admin account, the script wont work since it requires admin rights.\\\\n3.

If no playback is active, the bot changes the bio back to the original one from the user.\\\\n\\\\n## Setup\\\\n\\\\nThis script will do an interactive setup the first time you run bot.py. If you want to do it by yourself, you can follow the steps below, but that isn\\\\\\'t necessary anymore.\\\\n\\\\nJust remember to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\\\\n\\\\nDepreciated manual steps:\\\\n\\\\n0. Ensure you have python 3.6+ installed and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\\\\n1. Get your spotify client_id and your client_secret from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/. If you need more help, have a look [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app). Set a Rediret URI to http://localhost:1234/callback\\\\n2. Get your telegram app api_id and api_hash from https://my.telegram.org/. If you need more help, have a look [here](https://telethon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extra/basic/creating-a-client.html#creating-a-client).\\\\n3. If you want to have a log channel or group or so, paste its invite link or id in the LOG variable. If you leave it at \"me\", you will see those in your saved chat. Only if errors occur ofc ;)\\\\n4. Paste all these values in their respective variables at [constants.py](/constants.py). While you are at it, you can also paste an initial biography there. Just take your current one. This is highly recommended. If you don\\\\\\'t do this **and** have a currently playing track, the bot has at its first start no idea what your original biography is. Just do it, please.\\\\n5. You are going to generate a token here which is only valid for a short amount of time, so be sure to run generate.py quickly after this. Open the following link (change CLIENT_ID to you client_id): https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:1234/callback&scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-read-currently-playing\\\\n6. After you grant permission, you get redirected to https://example.com/callback?code=_. Copy everything after the code, this is you initial token.\\\\n7. Now you can run [generate.py](/generate.py). This will generate a json file named database.\\\\n8. You are almost done. If you now run [bot.py](/bot.py), all you need to do is log into your telegram account. Follow the instructions on screen.\\\\n9. Now you are really done.\\\\n\\\\n## Important Information\\\\n\\\\nYou can shut the bot down if you want/need to. Write `//stop` anywhere you want. If you want to change the command, edit SHUTDOWN_COMMAND in the [constants](/constants.py).\\\\n\\\\n## Warning\\\\n\\\\nThis bot uses the emoji 🎶 to determine if the current bio is an active spotify biography or not. This means you mustn\\\\\\'t use this emoji on your original biographies or the bot will probably break. Don\\\\\\'t do it, thanks.\\\\n\\\\n## But I want to\\\\n\\\\nGreat news. Just change the KEY variable in [constants](/constants.py) file. Don\\\\\\'t ever use your new KEY in your biographies though!\\\\n\\\\n## Issues? Need help? Want to tell me something?\\\\n\\\\nWell, just create an issue here. You can also ping me on [telegram](https://t.me/poolitzer).\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'tsmetana/spotify-tray\\', \\'language\\': \\'C\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'Spotify tray\\\\n============\\\\n\\\\nAdds a tray icon to the Spotify Linux client application.\\\\n\\\\nFeatures:\\\\n* Basic playback control through right-click menu\\\\n* Hiding the main client window (\"minimize to tray\")\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\n* Clone this repository\\\\n* `./autogen.sh`\\\\n* `./configure`\\\\n* `make`\\\\n* Optionally `make install` will put the resulting binary to `/usr/local/bin`\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n----------\\\\n\\\\nThis software is in no way official and has nothing to do with the Spotify Technology S.A. company.\\\\nIts only purpose is to add functionality missing in the official client.\\\\n\\\\nSpotify is a registered trademark of Spotify AB.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'rapito/go-spotify\\', \\'language\\': \\'Go\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'go-spotify\\\\n==========\\\\n\\\\n[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rapito/go-spotify/spotify?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/rapito/go-spotify/spotify)  [![baby-gopher](https://raw.github.com/drnic/babygopher-site/gh-pages/images/babygopher-logo-small.png)](http://www.babygopher.org)\\\\n\\\\nSimple Go library for the Spotify Web API\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n------------\\\\n```\\\\ngo get github.com/rapito/go-spotify/spotify\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHow-to-use\\\\n----------\\\\n\\\\n- Get Requests\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n    import \"fmt\"\\\\n    import \"github.com/rapito/go-spotify/spotify\"\\\\n    ...\\\\n    \\\\n    spot := spotify.New(clientID,clientSecret)\\\\n    result, _ := spot.Get(\"albums/%s\", nil, \"0sNOF9WDwhWunNAHPD3Baj\")\\\\n    \\\\n    fmt.Println(string(result))\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- Check out the *examples* folder for simple usage.\\\\n- Read some of the tests at *spotify_test.go* for more examples.\\\\n\\\\nContribution\\\\n------------\\\\n \\\\n - You may fork this library and modify it as you please.\\\\n - You can make a pull request and I will be happy to check it out and merge it.\\\\n - If you find a bug, create an issue and I will do my best to fix it (someday). \\\\n\\\\nConstraints\\\\n-------------\\\\n\\\\nRight now this API version can only make successful GET requests since \\\\nit just authenticates the application and not an specific user. \\\\nThis means you can use limited endpoints of spotify WEB API, as \\\\ndocumented on their web page:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nThe access token allows you to make requests to the Spotify Web \\\\nAPI endpoints that do not require user authorization such as the Get a \\\\ntrack endpoint...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTo see which endpoints you have access to, check out spotify web-api \\\\n[documentation.](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)\\\\n\\\\nBuy me a Drink\\\\n-------------\\\\n[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=FFC6KNAX9SKZU)\\\\n\\\\nLinks\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWhile I was on my *go-trip* to create this api, I found some awesome libs/links which made \\\\nmy life easier.\\\\nCheck them out, hopefully they\\\\\\'ll do the same for you:\\\\n \\\\n - http://github.com/parnurzeal/gorequest\\\\n - http://github.com/bmizerany/assert\\\\n - http://github.com/bitly/go-simplejson\\\\n - http://github.com/avelino/awesome-go\\\\n \\\\n Other APIs\\\\n ----------\\\\n \\\\n - http://github.com/rapito/go-shopify\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'pesaventofilippo/spotipybot\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# SpotiPyBot\\\\nA Python-written bot that can generate automatic listens to a given playlist.\\\\\\\\\\\\nIt now supports multi-account, multithreading and headless Chrome!\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n* First, clone this repo on your local machine with\\\\\\\\\\\\n```$ git clone https://github.com/pesaventofilippo/spotifybot.git```\\\\n\\\\n* Then, download the right **chromedriver** for your Chrome version from [here](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and put it under the ```drivers``` subfolder\\\\n\\\\n* Create a list of Spotify profiles for this program to use and write it in ```data/profiles.json```.\\\\\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\\\\\n```{```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```    \"credentials\": [```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```        {\"username\": \"firstprofile@example.com\",```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```            \"password\": \"first_password\"},```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```        {\"username\": \"secondprofile@example.com\",```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```            \"password\": \"second_password\"}```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```        {\"username\": \"thirdprofile@example.com\",```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```            \"password\": \"third_password\"}```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```    ]```\\\\\\\\\\\\n```}```\\\\n\\\\n* Done!

Inspired by [spotify2am](https://github.com/simonschellaert/spotify2am) am which didn\\'t work for me :D\\\\n\\\\n### [Downwload DMG](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/SpotifyImporter.dmg)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[![](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen1.png)](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen1.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Why ?\\\\nI created this project before [@maciej\\'s Playlist Importer](https://lupin.rocks/entry/seamlessly-import-your-spotify-playlists-into-itunes) show up, i am iOS developer and i wanted to try OS X development. Disadvantage of @maciej\\'s Playlist Importer is that you have to leave your Mac for a some time and it can\\'t import your songs in background. This project disadvantage it that you have to sniff iTunes packet to get your account identifiers and cookie but it works in background!\\\\n\\\\n# Usage\\\\n\\\\n## 1. Export from Spotify and import to SpotiyImporter\\\\n\\\\n1. Export the Spotify URIs\\\\n\\\\nYou can copy as many as you want, but remember - only single track URIs are supported. This is how it should look like:\\\\n\\\\n[![](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen2.png)](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen2.png)\\\\n\\\\n2. Export the Spotify songs to an CSV File\\\\n\\\\nThe first step is getting the songs you want to import into Apple Music into a CSV file. The simplest way to do this is using [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html).\\\\nIf you want to export you whole Spotify library, simply create a new playlist called All and drag your whole library into it using the Spotify desktop app. You can then export the playlist All using Exportify. Save the resulting file as spotify.csv in the same directory as the directory you cloned this repo into.\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Use an intercepting proxy to retrieve the Apple Music request headers\\\\n\\\\nWe are going to retrieve cookie data from iTunes using Charles Proxy.\\\\n\\\\n1. From the Menu Proxy go to SSL Proxy Settings\\\\n\\\\n2. Check \\'Enable SSL Proxying\\'\\\\n\\\\n3. Click on add and insert \\'*itunes.apple.com\\'\\\\n\\\\n4. In the same Menu check on \\'Mac OS X Proxy\\'\\\\n\\\\n5. Go to iTunes go to an Apple Music playlist but don\\'t do nothing\\\\n\\\\n6. Check you have enabled recording (please refer to image below)\\\\n\\\\n7. When recording is enabled add the playlist to my Music\\\\n\\\\n[![](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen3_thumb.png)](https://raw.github.com/m1entus/SpotifyImporter/master/Screens/screen3.png)\\\\n\\\\nApplication simply compares the title and artist to find out if a Spotify and Apple Music song match, additionaly if some of this didn\\'t match i am calculating matching score based on title of song. Some songs don\\'t have the exact same title (extraneous spacing for example) in both services.\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'areevesman/spotify-wrapped\\', \\'language\\': \\'Jupyter Notebook\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify Wrapped: Data Visualization and Machine Learning on Your Top\\\\xa0Songs\\\\n\\\\nThis repository contains the code and data used to accompany the blog post above.

It helps reducing number of items to render, hence there is significant performance boost if you have a large playlists collection. But the drawbacks is that item height is hard-coded, it messes up user interaction when we explicitly change, in CSS, playlist item height bigger than original value. So you need to add these 2 lines in Patch section in config file:\\\\r\\\\n```ini\\\\r\\\\n[Patch]\\\\r\\\\nxpui.js_find_8008 = ,(\\\\\\\\w+=)32,\\\\r\\\\nxpui.js_repl_8008 = ,${1}58,\\\\r\\\\n```\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n## Hide Window Controls\\\\r\\\\nWindows user, please edit your Spotify shortcut and add flag `--transparent-window-controls` after the Spotify.exe:\\\\r\\\\nTo edit a taskbar shortcut, right click it, then right click Spotify in the list again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/main/showcase-images/windows-shortcut-instruction.png\" alt=\"img\"> \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn addition to `--transparent-window-controls` you can set `Windows Top Bars` to `Solid` or `Transparent` to look like this:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/main/showcase-images/top-bars.png\" alt=\"img\" width=\"500px\"> \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n## Follow system dark/light theme (Powershell)\\\\r\\\\nAutomatic dark mode should work on MacOs and Linux out of the box.\\\\r\\\\nFrom Spotify > v1.1.70, dark mode is forced in Windows builds.

The server is to be used in conjunction with the front-end code of the cloned app found [here](https://github.com/JL978/spotify-clone-client)\\\\n\\\\n## Motivation\\\\nWhen working with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), you must follow this authorization [guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) provided on the API documentation. The basis of this authorization flow involve using a client id and client secret provided by signing up on the Spotify Developer dash board. These keys must be sent with every single request made to the Spotify server. \\\\n\\\\nWhen working with a client secret, one must keep it... well secret. Therefore, the solution to this is to keep the requests to the Spotify API on the server-side so that the client-side app can\\\\\\'t expose the secret key to potential attackers - making the app more secure. Authenitcation of users are also done through this server for the same purpose and a refresh_token is sent back as a cookie while an access token is sent back to be stored in memory. This authorization flow was built to avoid the most common types of cyber attack - Cross Site Scripting and Cross Site Request Forgery.\\\\n\\\\n## Tech/Framework Used\\\\n* Node.js\\\\n* Express.js\\\\n* axios\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\nThis project requires [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed globally. \\\\n\\\\nClone the repository to a directory of your choosing\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n$ git clone https://github.com/JL978/spotify-clone-server.git\\\\n```\\\\nNavigate into spotify-clone-server and install the necessary packages\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n$ npm install \\\\n```\\\\nTo run the server\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n$ npm start\\\\n```\\\\nTo run the dev server\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n$ npm run dev\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### **Other requirements**\\\\n[The Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)\\\\n\\\\nCreate a new .env file in the root folder and add the following key value pairs to the file\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nCLIENT_ID = [client id optained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard]\\\\nCLIENT_SECRET = [client secret optained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard]\\\\nFRONT_URI = http://localhost:3000\\\\nRE_URI = http://localhost:4000/callback\\\\nREXP = /\\\\\\\\.localhost:3000/\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\nThis server is to be consumed by a front-end application - namely the Spotify clone at this [repo](https://github.com/JL978/spotify-clone-client)\\\\n\\\\nThe following endpoints are available\\\\n\\\\n|Endpoint|Method|Body|Response|\\\\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|\\\\n|/|POST|{endpoint}|200 with the returned data from the endpoint|\\\\n|/login|GET|none|redirect to the Spotify authentication page|\\\\n|/refresh_token|GET|none|if a valid refresh token is available in the cookie, an access_token is sent back as data|\\\\n|/logout|GET|none|clear the refresh token and effectively log the user out off the app|\\\\n\\\\n## The architecture\\\\n### Client Credential Flow (un-authorized requests)\\\\n\\\\n![client credential flow](demo/unauthed.png)\\\\n\\\\nThe advantage of doing request this way instead of using the implicit grant flow as outlined in the Spotify API document is that you have a higher rate limit. It also doesn\\\\\\'t prompt the user to login, which would be a bad experience for users who don\\\\\\'t have a Spotify account but just want to browse their selections. \\\\n\\\\nAn improvement to this process would be to store the access_token in memory after the first request and use that for subsequent requests instead of requesting for a new access token on every request.\\\\n\\\\n### Authorization code flow \\\\n\\\\nThe majority of code flow is very similar to the authorization code flow as outlined in the API [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/), a diagram of which is shown bellow\\\\n\\\\n![spotify authorization flow](demo/spotify-auth.png)\\\\n\\\\nThe only difference with this server is that the sent back data at step 2 is the access_token as JSON so that the client can store that in memory (the client will now show the logged in version of the app) and set the refresh token in a cookie. At this point the client is free to make requests for personal data as outlined in step 3-4 however an issue would arise if the user refreshed the page. Since the access_token is stored in memory, the user would be logged out during page refresh and provide a bad user experience. To solve this issue, a /refresh_token endpoint is also provided. During any initial loading, the client checks for if their is a refresh_token stored in a cookie, if there is then it makes a request to the /refresh_token endpoint which uses the refresh_token to obtain a new access_key from the Spotify API. \\\\n\\\\n![refresh token flow](demo/refresh.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Logging out\\\\n\\\\nSince \"logged in\" just means that there is a refresh_token stored in cookies, to log the user out it is simply deleting the cookie and refresh the client.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'rweyant/spotifyr\\', \\'language\\': \\'R\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"# spotifyr: a wrapper for Spotify\\'s API for R users\\\\n\\\\n**spotifyr** is currently undergoing active testing and improvement.  \\\\n\\\\nIt currently launches [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) through [RSelenium](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium) for the full [authorization code flow](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization_code_flow).

Archiving this goal I had the following point in the back of my head:\\\\n\\\\n- Parallel downloads of multiple users\\\\n\\\\nSo I decided on the following project structure:\\\\n\\\\nspotify-ripper-docker:\\\\n- This is just a dockerized version of the spotify-ripper, including some adjustments to better handle the standard data streams and bring them to the web interface.\\\\n\\\\nspotify-ripper-web-backend:\\\\n- This is a node.js application which communicates with the frontend via websockets.\\\\n- It creates and starts new containers and forwards the standard data streams to the UI via Websocket.\\\\n\\\\nspotify-ripper-web-frontend:\\\\n- This is a vue.js spa, communicating with the node.js backend; Here you can also finally download the music.\\\\n\\\\n## Things that aren\\\\\\'t so beautiful:\\\\n\\\\n- The project actually consists of three projects, which would probably have been much more intelligent to separate.\\\\n- No TDD; not even the vue.js project\\\\n- Implemented the spotify-ripper as a zip file; this would also be a separate project...\\\\n- Not as much use of environment vars as I should have; there are some things hardcoded, like the websocket port\\\\n- Not the worst and ugliest code; but alsonot the cleanest one..\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\nThe installation should be quite simple by dockerization.\\\\n\\\\n### Prequesites\\\\n\\\\n1. Installing docker and docker-compose\\\\n2. rename `.env.example` to `.env` and change the path according tr environment.\\\\n3. add your `spotify_appkey.key` to the `spotify-ripper-docker` folder\\\\n4. (adjust `docker-compose.yml` to mount your docker.sock)\\\\n\\\\n### Run the application\\\\n\\\\nTo do this you can simply run `docker-compose up --build` (Depending on how you configured Docker, sudo may be required)\\\\n    \\\\nFYI: This whole repo is optimized and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.\\\\n    \\\\nIf all went well, it should look something like this: (remember that port 3000 is in the container and mapped outside by your adjustments in the `docker-compose.yml`)\\\\n    \\\\n![Console](/screenshots/screenshot_1.png \"Console\")\\\\n    \\\\nThen you should be able to access it by `http://localhost:<your_port>/web/`\\\\n\\\\n## Screenshots\\\\n\\\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_2.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_3.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_4.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\\\n![spotify-ripper web-ui](/screenshots/screenshot_5.png \"spotify-ripper web-ui\")\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'nations/spoticord\\', \\'language\\': \\'JavaScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# **Deprecated**\\\\n**In favor of [Discord\\\\\\'s Spotify Connection](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212).**\\\\n\\\\n# spoticord `0.0.4` [![discordxd](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/297142682894073856/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/nations)\\\\n**Display your current Spotify song on Discord using the RPC API:**\\\\n![N|Solid](https://s.phineas.io/share/68747470733acx.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Dependencies\\\\n  - NodeJS >=8\\\\n  - npm (>=5) or Yarn (>=1.2)\\\\n  - Discord Canary (preferred)\\\\n  - Spotify >= 1.0\\\\n  - Git\\\\n\\\\n## Setup\\\\n\\\\n  - Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/nations/spoticord.git`\\\\n  - Install the modules `npm i` or `yarn`\\\\n  - Open Discord & Spotify\\\\n  - Start the RPC app `node app.js`\\\\n  \\\\n## How to run in the background\\\\n\\\\n  - Install pm2 `npm i pm2 -g`\\\\n  - Start the app `pm2 start app.js --name=\"spoticord\"`\\\\n  - Use `pm2 log spoticord` to view the logs\\\\n  - Restart the app using `pm2 restart spoticord`\\\\n\\\\n## Updating\\\\n  - To update SpotiCord, enter the \"spoticord\" directory and run `git fetch` in your terminal.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n  Q: Can I get banned or punished by Discord for using this?  \\\\n  A: **No. The RPC was made by Discord themselves and Spoticord has been recommended by Discord staff**\\\\n\\\\n  Q: I don\\\\\\'t see the progress bar, where\\\\\\'s it gone?  \\\\n  A: **Make sure you\\\\\\'re using Discord Canary. Even still, Discord might remove this feature from time to time to update it since canary is a development version of Discord.**\\\\n\\\\n  Q: Can I host this on an external server?  \\\\n  A: **No, the Discord RPC api runs on your local Discord client, and unless you want to port forward a few things and create necessary firewall rules to do it, it\\\\\\'s not worth it. You\\\\\\'d have to repeat that with the Spotify web helper api, too.**\\\\n\\\\n  Q: I\\\\\\'m not experienced with this scope of programming, are there any tutorials?  \\\\n  A: **Yes!

The music industry is one of them. Should we treat any of those applications like a \"black box\", we would observe an input (data) and an output (product).\\\\n\\\\n## Scope\\\\nThis project aims to manipulate the Spotify music data with Python, having a twofold scope:\\\\n\\\\n✔️ proving that the existence of an API (Application Programming Interface) is of high importance, in terms of feeding algorithms with extra fine data.\\\\n\\\\n✔️ demonstrating how plain statistics (when properly applied) can encode daily actions, break them down into their fundamental elements and on top of them build valuable products.\\\\n\\\\n## Scenario\\\\n\\\\nLately, the Data Corp I work for as a data scientist, records remarkable profits from their Youth Marketing segment and in reward for this, it rewards its young customers with a party. In the absence of a DJ, my supervisor asked me to take care of the music and make the party last until the morning! She gave to me a number of Spotify playlists, the PR department had already created, in order to check them out and create the final one. My blindness to the modern music generally, leads me to a tricky alternative:\\\\n\\\\n*How about accessing all the playlists using Python, extracting every single audio feature of each track, reason about them statistically and wrapping  the most suitable (to our party) tracks to a final playlist? Given of course a technicality: I am not going to hear a single beat of any of them!*\\\\n\\\\n## Roadmap\\\\n\\\\nWe make requests to the Spotify API for data collection, using the free Python libraries, Spotipy and Requests. We access the user playlists, tracks and perform EDA on their audio features, using Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib. A number of data visualizations are depicted, to better communicate the results. Finally, we create the final playlist of tracks.\\\\n\\\\n## Authorization Flow Guide\\\\n\\\\n1. Sign up at Spotify for Developers at https://developer.spotify.com/ and select \"Create an app\". Write down your \\\\\\'Client ID\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'Client Secret\\\\\\'. While in the \"Dashboard\", select the \"Edit settings\" menu and in the \"Redirect URIs\" field fill the: http://localhost:7777/callback.\\\\n2. Open Spotify_Data_Manipulation_Python.ipynb and in the Authorization Flow code block, insert your Spotify username, Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI as `cid`, `secret`, `redirect_uri` and `username`, respectively.\\\\n3. Execute it. The first time Spotipy will need user authentication and will open a webpage, asking you to log in with your Spotify account and accept the permissions. After doing so, it will redirect you to a link. Copy the \\\\\\'Redirect URI\\\\\\' and paste in the field that will appear in the Notebook. Hit \\\\\\'enter\\\\\\'.\\\\n4. Now, you are connected to the Spotify API and capable to get your playlists ID, song IDs and use them to extract the features.\\\\n\\\\n## Additional Analysis\\\\nThere is quite a number of additional analyses to be performed, expanding this one. You are welcome to extend and shape yours in any direction you may prefer. For instance, you can additionally try and remove the tracks that have significantly low `danceability` and `valence` audio features, and boost even more the playlist\\\\\\'s `score`. Furthemore, you can apply each approach sequentially (on the dataframe that is produced each time).\\\\n\\\\n## Authors and Acknowledgement\\\\n[*It stands as an independent analysis in an effort to enhance my ability to communicate results, reason about data statistically and stay motivated to continuously implement newly aquired skills & capabilities, so as to enrich my portfolio of data science-oriented projects*]\\\\n- [@makispl](https://github.com/makispl) for concept & implementation.\\\\n- [@MPlegas](https://twitter.com/MPlegas) Twitter\\\\n- [@gerasimos_plegas](https://medium.com/@gerasimos_plegas) Medium\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'sopheamen007/app.mobile.spotify-app-ui\\', \\'language\\': \\'Dart\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify Clone\\\\n\\\\n- [Support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sopheamenvan?fan_landing=true)\\\\n- [Watch on youtube](https://youtu.be/DwuhsESnTBk)\\\\n\\\\n![App UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16510597/112126923-80dbbf00-8bf7-11eb-9b6c-89cf3180889f.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nA new Flutter project.\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started\\\\n\\\\nThis project is a starting point for a Flutter application.\\\\n\\\\nA few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:\\\\n\\\\n- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)\\\\n- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)\\\\n\\\\nFor help getting started with Flutter, view our\\\\n[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,\\\\nsamples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'matiassingers/spotify-crawler\\', \\'language\\': \\'JavaScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# spotify-crawler [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/matiassingers/spotify-crawler.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/matiassingers/spotify-crawler) [![Dependency Status](http://img.shields.io/gemnasium/matiassingers/spotify-crawler.svg?style=flat-square)](https://gemnasium.com/matiassingers/spotify-crawler) [![Gitter](http://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-join%20chat%20%E2%86%92-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://gitter.im/matiassingers/spotify-crawler?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\\\\n> Returns pricing data for all available Spotify countries\\\\n\\\\nCrawls the [list](https://www.spotify.com/select-your-country/) of countries where Spotify is available.\\\\nFetches the listed premium price for each country and finally converts the price into USD.\\\\n\\\\nThanks to [restcoutries.eu](http://restcountries.eu/) and [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/).\\\\n\\\\n## Installation\\\\n\\\\n```shell\\\\n$ npm install spotify-crawler\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\n**Methods:**\\\\n- `fetch` -

For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>\\\\nYou need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.\\\\n\\\\nOnly files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>\\\\nRead instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.\\\\n\\\\nYou can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>\\\\nThey will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.\\\\n\\\\n## Available Scripts\\\\n\\\\nIn the project directory, you can run:\\\\n\\\\n### `npm start`\\\\n\\\\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br>\\\\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\\\\n\\\\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br>\\\\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\\\\n\\\\n### `npm test`\\\\n\\\\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>\\\\nSee the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.\\\\n\\\\n### `npm run build`\\\\n\\\\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\\\\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\\\\n\\\\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\\\\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\\\\n\\\\nSee the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.\\\\n\\\\n### `npm run eject`\\\\n\\\\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**\\\\n\\\\nIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\\\\n\\\\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.\\\\n\\\\nYou don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.\\\\n\\\\n## Supported Language Features and Polyfills\\\\n\\\\nThis project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard.<br>\\\\nIn addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:\\\\n\\\\n* [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).\\\\n* [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).\\\\n* [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) (stage 3 proposal).\\\\n* [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 3 proposal)\\\\n* [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (stage 2 proposal).\\\\n* [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) syntax.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).\\\\n\\\\nWhile we recommend to use experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.\\\\n\\\\nNote that **the project only includes a few ES6 [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)**:\\\\n\\\\n* [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) via [`object-assign`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign).\\\\n* [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) via [`promise`](https://github.com/then/promise).\\\\n* [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) via [`whatwg-fetch`](https://github.com/github/fetch).\\\\n\\\\nIf you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.\\\\n\\\\n## Syntax Highlighting in the Editor\\\\n\\\\nTo configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.\\\\n\\\\n## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.<br>\\\\n>It also only works with npm 3 or higher.\\\\n\\\\nSome editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.\\\\n\\\\nThey are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.\\\\n\\\\nYou would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first. Then, add a file called `.eslintrc` to the project root:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n{\\\\n  \"extends\": \"react-app\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow your editor should report the linting warnings.\\\\n\\\\nNote that even if you edit your `.eslintrc` file further, these changes will **only affect the editor integration**. They won’t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) instead of ESLint style rules.\\\\n\\\\n## Debugging in the Editor\\\\n\\\\n**This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.**\\\\n\\\\nVisual Studio Code supports debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.\\\\n\\\\nYou would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and VS Code [Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.\\\\n\\\\nThen add the block below to your `launch.json` file and put it inside the `.vscode` folder in your app’s root directory.\\\\n\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\\\\n  \"configurations\": [{\\\\n    \"name\": \"Chrome\",\\\\n    \"type\": \"chrome\",\\\\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\\\\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\\\\n    \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}/src\",\\\\n    \"userDataDir\": \"${workspaceRoot}/.vscode/chrome\",\\\\n    \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\\\\n      \"webpack:///src/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  }]\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nStart your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code—all from your editor.\\\\n\\\\n## Formatting Code Automatically\\\\n\\\\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, CSS and JSON. With Prettier you can format the code you write automatically to ensure a code style within your project. See the [Prettier\\\\\\'s GitHub page](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for more information, and look at this [page to see it in action](https://prettier.github.io/prettier/).\\\\n\\\\nTo format our code whenever we make a commit in git, we need to install the following dependencies:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save husky lint-staged prettier\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add husky lint-staged prettier\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n* `husky` makes it easy to use githooks as if they are npm scripts.\\\\n* `lint-staged` allows us to run scripts on staged files in git. See this [blog post about lint-staged to learn more about it](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/make-linting-great-again-f3890e1ad6b8).\\\\n* `prettier` is the JavaScript formatter we will run before commits.\\\\n\\\\nNow we can make sure every file is formatted correctly by adding a few lines to the `package.json` in the project root.\\\\n\\\\nAdd the following line to `scripts` section:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n  \"scripts\": {\\\\n+   \"precommit\": \"lint-staged\",\\\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNext we add a \\\\\\'lint-staged\\\\\\' field to the `package.json`, for example:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n  \"dependencies\": {\\\\n    // ...\\\\n  },\\\\n+ \"lint-staged\": {\\\\n+   \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css}\": [\\\\n+     \"prettier --single-quote --write\",\\\\n+     \"git add\"\\\\n+   ]\\\\n+ },\\\\n  \"scripts\": {\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow, whenever you make a commit, Prettier will format the changed files automatically. You can also run `./node_modules/.bin/prettier --single-quote --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx}\"` to format your entire project for the first time.\\\\n\\\\nNext you might want to integrate Prettier in your favorite editor. Read the section on [Editor Integration](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration) on the Prettier GitHub page.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the Page `<title>`\\\\n\\\\nYou can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from “React App” to anything else.\\\\n\\\\nNote that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) is done without touching the HTML.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), a third party library.\\\\n\\\\nIf you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in [this section](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server). Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered [here](#pre-rendering-into-static-html-files).\\\\n\\\\n## Installing a Dependency\\\\n\\\\nThe generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save react-router\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add react-router\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis works for any library, not just `react-router`.\\\\n\\\\n## Importing a Component\\\\n\\\\nThis project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.<br>\\\\nWhile you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n### `Button.js`\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React, { Component } from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nclass Button extends Component {\\\\n  render() {\\\\n    // ...\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nexport default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### `DangerButton.js`\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React, { Component } from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\nimport Button from \\\\\\'./Button\\\\\\'; // Import a component from another file\\\\n\\\\nclass DangerButton extends Component {\\\\n  render() {\\\\n    return <Button color=\"red\" />;\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nexport default DangerButton;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBe aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.\\\\n\\\\nWe suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from \\\\\\'./Button\\\\\\'`.\\\\n\\\\nNamed exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about ES6 modules:\\\\n\\\\n* [When to use the curly braces?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281)\\\\n* [Exploring ES6: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)\\\\n* [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)\\\\n\\\\n## Code Splitting\\\\n\\\\nInstead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.\\\\n\\\\nThis project setup supports code splitting via [dynamic `import()`](http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#loading-code-on-demand). Its [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is in stage 3. The `import()` function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example:\\\\n\\\\n### `moduleA.js`\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nconst moduleA = \\\\\\'Hello\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nexport { moduleA };\\\\n```\\\\n### `App.js`\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React, { Component } from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nclass App extends Component {\\\\n  handleClick = () => {\\\\n    import(\\\\\\'./moduleA\\\\\\')\\\\n      .then(({ moduleA }) => {\\\\n        // Use moduleA\\\\n      })\\\\n      .catch(err => {\\\\n        // Handle failure\\\\n      });\\\\n  };\\\\n\\\\n  render() {\\\\n    return (\\\\n      <div>\\\\n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\\\\n      </div>\\\\n    );\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nexport default App;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will make `moduleA.js` and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the \\\\\\'Load\\\\\\' button.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also use it with `async` / `await` syntax if you prefer it.\\\\n\\\\n### With React Router\\\\n\\\\nIf you are using React Router check out [this tutorial](http://serverless-stack.com/chapters/code-splitting-in-create-react-app.html) on how to use code splitting with it. You can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-client/tree/code-splitting-in-create-react-app).\\\\n\\\\n## Adding a Stylesheet\\\\n\\\\nThis project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:\\\\n\\\\n### `Button.css`\\\\n\\\\n```css\\\\n.Button {\\\\n  padding: 20px;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### `Button.js`\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React, { Component } from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\nimport \\\\\\'./Button.css\\\\\\'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles\\\\n\\\\nclass Button extends Component {\\\\n  render() {\\\\n    // You can use them as regular CSS styles\\\\n    return <div className=\"Button\" />;\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.\\\\n\\\\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\\\\n\\\\n## Post-Processing CSS\\\\n\\\\nThis project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, this:\\\\n\\\\n```css\\\\n.App {\\\\n  display: flex;\\\\n  flex-direction: row;\\\\n  align-items: center;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nbecomes this:\\\\n\\\\n```css\\\\n.App {\\\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\\\n  display: flex;\\\\n  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;\\\\n  -webkit-box-direction: normal;\\\\n      -ms-flex-direction: row;\\\\n          flex-direction: row;\\\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\\\n      -ms-flex-align: center;\\\\n          align-items: center;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, [follow this section](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#disabling).\\\\n\\\\n## Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)\\\\n\\\\nGenerally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).\\\\n\\\\nFollowing this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save node-sass-chokidar\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add node-sass-chokidar\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen in `package.json`, add the following lines to `scripts`:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n   \"scripts\": {\\\\n+    \"build-css\": \"node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/\",\\\\n+    \"watch-css\": \"npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive\",\\\\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n     \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n     \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n>Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace `build-css` and `watch-css` commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.\\\\n\\\\nNow you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and run `npm run watch-css`. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting `src/App.css`. Since `src/App.js` still imports `src/App.css`, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit `src/App.scss`, and `src/App.css` will be regenerated.\\\\n\\\\nTo share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import \"./shared.scss\";` with variable definitions.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable importing files without using relative paths, you can add the  `--include-path` option to the command in `package.json`.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\"build-css\": \"node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/\",\\\\n\"watch-css\": \"npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will allow you to do imports like\\\\n\\\\n```scss\\\\n@import \\\\\\'styles/_colors.scss\\\\\\'; // assuming a styles directory under src/\\\\n@import \\\\\\'nprogress/nprogress\\\\\\'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAt this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add `src/**/*.css` to your `.gitignore` file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.\\\\n\\\\nAs a final step, you may find it convenient to run `watch-css` automatically with `npm start`, and run `build-css` as a part of `npm run build`. You can use the `&&` operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save npm-run-all\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add npm-run-all\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen we can change `start` and `build` scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n   \"scripts\": {\\\\n     \"build-css\": \"node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/\",\\\\n     \"watch-css\": \"npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive\",\\\\n-    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n-    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n+    \"start-js\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n+    \"start\": \"npm-run-all -p watch-css start-js\",\\\\n+    \"build\": \"npm run build-css && react-scripts build\",\\\\n     \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\\\\n     \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\\\\n   }\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow running `npm start` and `npm run build` also builds Sass files.\\\\n\\\\n**Why `node-sass-chokidar`?**\\\\n\\\\n`node-sass` has been reported as having the following issues:\\\\n\\\\n- `node-sass --watch` has been reported to have *performance issues* in certain conditions when used in a virtual machine or with docker.\\\\n\\\\n- Infinite styles compiling [#1939](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1939)\\\\n\\\\n- `node-sass` has been reported as having issues with detecting new files in a directory [#1891](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1891)\\\\n\\\\n `node-sass-chokidar` is used here as it addresses these issues.\\\\n\\\\n## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files\\\\n\\\\nWith Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\\\\n\\\\nYou can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.\\\\n\\\\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1153).\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\nimport logo from \\\\\\'./logo.png\\\\\\'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image\\\\n\\\\nconsole.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png\\\\n\\\\nfunction Header() {\\\\n  // Import result is the URL of your image\\\\n  return <img src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" />;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nexport default Header;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\\\\n\\\\nThis works in CSS too:\\\\n\\\\n```css\\\\n.Logo {\\\\n  background-image: url(./logo.png);\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\\\\n\\\\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.\\\\n\\\\n**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>\\\\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\\\\n\\\\n## Using the `public` Folder\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\n### Changing the HTML\\\\n\\\\nThe `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to [set the page title](#changing-the-page-title).\\\\nThe `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.\\\\n\\\\n### Adding Assets Outside of the Module System\\\\n\\\\nYou can also add other assets to the `public` folder.\\\\n\\\\nNote that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.\\\\nFor example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) and [adding images and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files).\\\\nThis mechanism provides a number of benefits:\\\\n\\\\n* Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.\\\\n* Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.\\\\n* Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.\\\\n\\\\nHowever there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.\\\\n\\\\nIf you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.\\\\n\\\\nInside `index.html`, you can use it like this:\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\">\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nOnly files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.\\\\n\\\\nIn JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nrender() {\\\\n  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!\\\\n  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs\\\\n  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.\\\\n  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \\\\\\'/img/logo.png\\\\\\'} />;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind the downsides of this approach:\\\\n\\\\n* None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.\\\\n* Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.\\\\n* Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.\\\\n\\\\n### When to Use the `public` Folder\\\\n\\\\nNormally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript.\\\\nThe `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:\\\\n\\\\n* You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).\\\\n* You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.\\\\n* You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.\\\\n* Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.\\\\n\\\\nNote that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.\\\\n\\\\n## Using Global Variables\\\\n\\\\nWhen you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.\\\\n\\\\nYou can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nconst $ = window.$;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it.\\\\n\\\\n## Adding Bootstrap\\\\n\\\\nYou don’t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:\\\\n\\\\nInstall React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nImport Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your ```src/index.js``` file:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport \\\\\\'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\\\\\\';\\\\nimport \\\\\\'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css\\\\\\';\\\\n// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your\\\\n// components takes precedence over default styles.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nImport required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from \\\\\\'react-bootstrap\\\\\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [`App.js`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap.\\\\n\\\\n### Using a Custom Theme\\\\n\\\\nSometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).<br>\\\\nWe suggest the following approach:\\\\n\\\\n* Create a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap.\\\\n* Add the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm.\\\\n* Install your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example of adding a [customized Bootstrap](https://medium.com/@tacomanator/customizing-create-react-app-aa9ffb88165) that follows these steps.\\\\n\\\\n## Adding Flow\\\\n\\\\nFlow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.\\\\n\\\\nRecent versions of [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) work with Create React App projects out of the box.\\\\n\\\\nTo add Flow to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Run `npm install --save flow-bin` (or `yarn add flow-bin`).\\\\n2. Add `\"flow\": \"flow\"` to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.\\\\n3. Run `npm run flow init` (or `yarn flow init`) to create a [`.flowconfig` file](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html) in the root directory.\\\\n4. Add `// @flow` to any files you want to type check (for example, to `src/App.js`).\\\\n\\\\nNow you can run `npm run flow` (or `yarn flow`) to check the files for type errors.\\\\nYou can optionally use an IDE like [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/) for a better integrated experience.\\\\nIn the future we plan to integrate it into Create React App even more closely.\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more about Flow, check out [its documentation](https://flowtype.org/).\\\\n\\\\n## Adding Custom Environment Variables\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nYour project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By\\\\ndefault you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with\\\\n`REACT_APP_`.\\\\n\\\\n**The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like [described here](#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.\\\\n\\\\n>Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\\\\n\\\\nThese environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment\\\\nvariable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`.\\\\n\\\\nThere is also a special built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `\\\\\\'development\\\\\\'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `\\\\\\'test\\\\\\'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `\\\\\\'production\\\\\\'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.\\\\n\\\\nThese environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is\\\\ndeployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined\\\\nin the environment inside a `<form>`:\\\\n\\\\n```jsx\\\\nrender() {\\\\n  return (\\\\n    <div>\\\\n      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>\\\\n      <form>\\\\n        <input type=\"hidden\" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />\\\\n      </form>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  );\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nDuring the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<div>\\\\n  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>\\\\n  <form>\\\\n    <input type=\"hidden\" value=\"abcdef\" />\\\\n  </form>\\\\n</div>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this\\\\nvalue, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in\\\\na `.env` file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.\\\\n\\\\nHaving access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \\\\\\'production\\\\\\') {\\\\n  analytics.disable();\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen you compile the app with `npm run build`, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.\\\\n\\\\n### Referencing Environment Variables in the HTML\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also access the environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_` in the `public/index.html`. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<title>%REACT_APP_WEBSITE_NAME%</title>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNote that the caveats from the above section apply:\\\\n\\\\n* Apart from a few built-in variables (`NODE_ENV` and `PUBLIC_URL`), variable names must start with `REACT_APP_` to work.\\\\n* The environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, [follow this approach instead](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server).\\\\n\\\\n### Adding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell\\\\n\\\\nDefining environment variables can vary between OSes. It’s also important to know that this manner is temporary for the\\\\nlife of the shell session.\\\\n\\\\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\\\\n\\\\n```cmd\\\\nset REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef&&npm start\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\\\\n\\\\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nTo define permanent environment variables, create a file called `.env` in the root of your project:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n`.env` files **should be** checked into source control (with the exclusion of `.env*.local`).\\\\n\\\\n#### What other `.env` files are can be used?\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is **available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher**.\\\\n\\\\n* `.env`: Default.\\\\n* `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**\\\\n* `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.\\\\n* `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.\\\\n\\\\nFiles on the left have more priority than files on the right:\\\\n\\\\n* `npm start`: `.env.development.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`\\\\n* `npm run build`: `.env.production.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.local`, `.env`\\\\n* `npm test`: `.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env` (note `.env.local` is missing)\\\\n\\\\nThese variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.<br>\\\\nPlease refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.\\\\n\\\\n>Note: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need\\\\nthese defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).\\\\n\\\\n## Can I Use Decorators?\\\\n\\\\nMany popular libraries use [decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841) in their documentation.<br>\\\\nCreate React App doesn’t support decorator syntax at the moment because:\\\\n\\\\n* It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change.\\\\n* The current specification version is not officially supported by Babel.\\\\n* If the specification changes, we won’t be able to write a codemod because we don’t use them internally at Facebook.\\\\n\\\\nHowever in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators just as fine.<br>\\\\nPlease refer to these two threads for reference:\\\\n\\\\n* [#214](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/214)\\\\n* [#411](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/411)\\\\n\\\\nCreate React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.\\\\n\\\\n## Integrating with an API Backend\\\\n\\\\nThese tutorials will help you to integrate your app with an API backend running on another port,\\\\nusing `fetch()` to access it.\\\\n\\\\n### Node\\\\nCheck out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/).\\\\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo).\\\\n\\\\n### Ruby on Rails\\\\n\\\\nCheck out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/).\\\\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails).\\\\n\\\\n## Proxying API Requests in Development\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nPeople often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.<br>\\\\nFor example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/             - static server returns index.html with React app\\\\n/todos        - static server returns index.html with React app\\\\n/api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSuch setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch(\\\\\\'/api/todos\\\\\\')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.\\\\n\\\\nTo tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n  \"proxy\": \"http://localhost:4000\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis way, when you `fetch(\\\\\\'/api/todos\\\\\\')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without a `text/html` accept header to the proxy.\\\\n\\\\nConveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nFetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No \\\\\\'Access-Control-Allow-Origin\\\\\\' header is present on the requested resource. Origin \\\\\\'http://localhost:3000\\\\\\' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request\\\\\\'s mode to \\\\\\'no-cors\\\\\\' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.\\\\n\\\\nThe `proxy` option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.<br>\\\\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:\\\\n\\\\n* [Configure the proxy yourself](#configuring-the-proxy-manually)\\\\n* Enable CORS on your server ([here’s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)).\\\\n* Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app.\\\\n\\\\n### \"Invalid Host Header\" Errors After Configuring Proxy\\\\n\\\\nWhen you enable the `proxy` option, you opt into a more strict set of host checks. This is necessary because leaving the backend open to remote hosts makes your computer vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The issue is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a) and [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887).\\\\n\\\\nThis shouldn’t affect you when developing on `localhost`, but if you develop remotely like [described here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2271), you will see this error in the browser after enabling the `proxy` option:\\\\n\\\\n>Invalid Host header\\\\n\\\\nTo work around it, you can specify your public development host in a file called `.env.development` in the root of your project:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nHOST=mypublicdevhost.com\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you restart the development server now and load the app from the specified host, it should work.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are still having issues or if you’re using a more exotic environment like a cloud editor, you can bypass the host check completely by adding a line to `.env.development.local`. **Note that this is dangerous and exposes your machine to remote code execution from malicious websites:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n# NOTE: THIS IS DANGEROUS!\\\\n# It exposes your machine to attacks from the websites you visit.\\\\nDANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe don’t recommend this approach.\\\\n\\\\n### Configuring the Proxy Manually\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, you can specify an object in the following form (in `package.json`).<br>\\\\nYou may also specify any configuration value [`http-proxy-middleware`](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#options) or [`http-proxy`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options) supports.\\\\n```js\\\\n{\\\\n  // ...\\\\n  \"proxy\": {\\\\n    \"/api\": {\\\\n      \"target\": \"<url>\",\\\\n      \"ws\": true\\\\n      // ...\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n  // ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAll requests matching this path will be proxies, no exceptions. This includes requests for `text/html`, which the standard `proxy` option does not proxy.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to specify multiple proxies, you may do so by specifying additional entries.\\\\nYou may also narrow down matches using `*` and/or `**`, to match the path exactly or any subpath.\\\\n```js\\\\n{\\\\n  // ...\\\\n  \"proxy\": {\\\\n    // Matches any request starting with /api\\\\n    \"/api\": {\\\\n      \"target\": \"<url_1>\",\\\\n      \"ws\": true\\\\n      // ...\\\\n    },\\\\n    // Matches any request starting with /foo\\\\n    \"/foo\": {\\\\n      \"target\": \"<url_2>\",\\\\n      \"ssl\": true,\\\\n      \"pathRewrite\": {\\\\n        \"^/foo\": \"/foo/beta\"\\\\n      }\\\\n      // ...\\\\n    },\\\\n    // Matches /bar/abc.html but not /bar/sub/def.html\\\\n    \"/bar/*.html\": {\\\\n      \"target\": \"<url_3>\",\\\\n      // ...\\\\n    },\\\\n    // Matches /baz/abc.html and /baz/sub/def.html\\\\n    \"/baz/**/*.html\": {\\\\n      \"target\": \"<url_4>\"\\\\n      // ...\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n  // ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Configuring a WebSocket Proxy\\\\n\\\\nWhen setting up a WebSocket proxy, there are a some extra considerations to be aware of.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re using a WebSocket engine like [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), you must have a Socket.io server running that you can use as the proxy target. Socket.io will not work with a standard WebSocket server. Specifically, don\\\\\\'t expect Socket.io to work with [the websocket.org echo test](http://websocket.org/echo.html).\\\\n\\\\nThere’s some good documentation available for [setting up a Socket.io server](https://socket.io/docs/).\\\\n\\\\nStandard WebSockets **will** work with a standard WebSocket server as well as the websocket.org echo test. You can use libraries like [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for the server, with [native WebSockets in the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).\\\\n\\\\nEither way, you can proxy WebSocket requests manually in `package.json`:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n{\\\\n  // ...\\\\n  \"proxy\": {\\\\n    \"/socket\": {\\\\n      // Your compatible WebSocket server\\\\n      \"target\": \"ws://<socket_url>\",\\\\n      // Tell http-proxy-middleware that this is a WebSocket proxy.\\\\n      // Also allows you to proxy WebSocket requests without an additional HTTP request\\\\n      // https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#external-websocket-upgrade\\\\n      \"ws\": true\\\\n      // ...\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n  // ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Using HTTPS in Development\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nYou may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the \"proxy\" feature](#proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\\\\n\\\\nTo do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:\\\\n\\\\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\\\\n\\\\n```cmd\\\\nset HTTPS=true&&npm start\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\\\\n\\\\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nHTTPS=true npm start\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\\\\n\\\\n## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server\\\\n\\\\nSince Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<!doctype html>\\\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\\\n  <head>\\\\n    <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"__OG_TITLE__\">\\\\n    <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"__OG_DESCRIPTION__\">\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `__OG_TITLE__`, `__OG_DESCRIPTION__`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!\\\\n\\\\nIf you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.\\\\n\\\\n## Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re hosting your `build` with a static hosting provider you can use [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.\\\\n\\\\nThere are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.\\\\n\\\\nThe primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.\\\\n\\\\nYou can read more about [zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319).\\\\n\\\\n## Injecting Data from the Server into the Page\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n<!doctype html>\\\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\\\n  <head>\\\\n    <script>\\\\n      window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;\\\\n    </script>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen, on the server, you can replace `__SERVER_DATA__` with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read `window.SERVER_DATA` to use it. **Make sure to [sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client](https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0) as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.**\\\\n\\\\n## Running Tests\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br>\\\\n>[Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)\\\\n\\\\nCreate React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.\\\\n\\\\nJest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.\\\\n\\\\nWhile Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.\\\\n\\\\n### Filename Conventions\\\\n\\\\nJest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:\\\\n\\\\n* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.\\\\n* Files with `.test.js` suffix.\\\\n* Files with `.spec.js` suffix.\\\\n\\\\nThe `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from \\\\\\'./App\\\\\\'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.\\\\n\\\\n### Command Line Interface\\\\n\\\\nWhen you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.\\\\n\\\\nThe watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:\\\\n\\\\n![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif)\\\\n\\\\n### Version Control Integration\\\\n\\\\nBy default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.\\\\n\\\\nJest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.\\\\n\\\\nJest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.\\\\n\\\\n### Writing Tests\\\\n\\\\nTo create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.\\\\n\\\\nJest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport sum from \\\\\\'./sum\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nit(\\\\\\'sums numbers\\\\\\', () => {\\\\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);\\\\n  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAll `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br>\\\\nYou can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create “spies” or mock functions.\\\\n\\\\n### Testing Components\\\\n\\\\nThere is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.\\\\n\\\\nDifferent projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\nimport ReactDOM from \\\\\\'react-dom\\\\\\';\\\\nimport App from \\\\\\'./App\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nit(\\\\\\'renders without crashing\\\\\\', () => {\\\\n  const div = document.createElement(\\\\\\'div\\\\\\');\\\\n  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). To install it, run:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save enzyme react-test-renderer\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add enzyme react-test-renderer\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can write a smoke test with it too:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\nimport { shallow } from \\\\\\'enzyme\\\\\\';\\\\nimport App from \\\\\\'./App\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nit(\\\\\\'renders without crashing\\\\\\', () => {\\\\n  shallow(<App />);\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nUnlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\nYou can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport React from \\\\\\'react\\\\\\';\\\\nimport { shallow } from \\\\\\'enzyme\\\\\\';\\\\nimport App from \\\\\\'./App\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\nit(\\\\\\'renders welcome message\\\\\\', () => {\\\\n  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);\\\\n  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;\\\\n  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);\\\\n  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAll Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br>\\\\nNevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you might find [jest-enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above `contains` code can be written simpler with jest-enzyme.\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nexpect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTo enable this, install `jest-enzyme`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save jest-enzyme\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add jest-enzyme\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nImport it in [`src/setupTests.js`](#initializing-test-environment) to make its matchers available in every test:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport \\\\\\'jest-enzyme\\\\\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Using Third Party Assertion Libraries\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport sinon from \\\\\\'sinon\\\\\\';\\\\nimport { expect } from \\\\\\'chai\\\\\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nand then use them in your tests like you normally do.\\\\n\\\\n### Initializing Test Environment\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nIf your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.js` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n#### `src/setupTests.js`\\\\n```js\\\\nconst localStorageMock = {\\\\n  getItem: jest.fn(),\\\\n  setItem: jest.fn(),\\\\n  clear: jest.fn()\\\\n};\\\\nglobal.localStorage = localStorageMock\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Focusing and Excluding Tests\\\\n\\\\nYou can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.<br>\\\\nSimilarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.\\\\n\\\\n### Coverage Reporting\\\\n\\\\nJest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>\\\\nRun `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:\\\\n\\\\n![coverage report](http://i.imgur.com/5bFhnTS.png)\\\\n\\\\nNote that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.\\\\n\\\\n### Continuous Integration\\\\n\\\\nBy default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.\\\\n\\\\nWhen creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.\\\\n\\\\nPopular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:\\\\n\\\\n### On CI servers\\\\n#### Travis CI\\\\n\\\\n1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis.  You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.\\\\n1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.\\\\n```\\\\nlanguage: node_js\\\\nnode_js:\\\\n  - 6\\\\ncache:\\\\n  directories:\\\\n    - node_modules\\\\nscript:\\\\n  - npm test\\\\n  - npm run build\\\\n```\\\\n1. Trigger your first build with a git push.\\\\n1. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.\\\\n\\\\n#### CircleCI\\\\n\\\\nFollow [this article](https://medium.com/@knowbody/circleci-and-zeits-now-sh-c9b7eebcd3c1) to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.\\\\n\\\\n### On your own environment\\\\n##### Windows (cmd.exe)\\\\n\\\\n```cmd\\\\nset CI=true&&npm test\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```cmd\\\\nset CI=true&&npm run build\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\\\\n\\\\n##### Linux, macOS (Bash)\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nCI=true npm test\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nCI=true npm run build\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.\\\\n\\\\n>  If you find yourself doing this often in development, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new) to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.\\\\n\\\\nThe build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.\\\\n\\\\n### Disabling jsdom\\\\n\\\\nBy default, the `package.json` of the generated project looks like this:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n  \"scripts\": {\\\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely remove `--env=jsdom`, and your tests will run faster:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n  \"scripts\": {\\\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n-   \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\"\\\\n+   \"test\": \"react-scripts test\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTo help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:\\\\n\\\\n* Any browser globals like `window` and `document`\\\\n* [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)\\\\n* [`TestUtils.renderIntoDocument()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) ([a shortcut](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/34761cf9a252964abfaab6faf74d473ad95d1f21/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L83-L91) for the above)\\\\n* [`mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:\\\\n\\\\n* [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)\\\\n* [`shallow()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\\\\n\\\\nFinally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).\\\\n\\\\n### Snapshot Testing\\\\n\\\\nSnapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. [Read more about snapshot testing.](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)\\\\n\\\\n### Editor Integration\\\\n\\\\nIf you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.\\\\n\\\\n![VS Code Jest Preview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/20795349/a032308a-b7c8-11e6-9b34-7eeac781003f.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Developing Components in Isolation\\\\n\\\\nUsually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.\\\\nFor an example, a simple button component could have following states:\\\\n\\\\n* In a regular state, with a text label.\\\\n* In the disabled mode.\\\\n* In a loading state.\\\\n\\\\nUsually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.\\\\n\\\\nCreate React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add [Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org) ([source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)) or [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)) to your project. **These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.\\\\n\\\\n![Storybook for React Demo](http://i.imgur.com/7CIAWpB.gif)\\\\n\\\\nYou can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.\\\\n\\\\n### Getting Started with Storybook\\\\n\\\\nStorybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, install the following npm package globally:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install -g @storybook/cli\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\ngetstorybook\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about React Storybook:\\\\n\\\\n* Screencast: [Getting Started with React Storybook](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-getting-started-with-react-storybook)\\\\n* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)\\\\n* [Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/introduction/)\\\\n* [Snapshot Testing UI](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots) with Storybook + addon/storyshot\\\\n\\\\n### Getting Started with Styleguidist\\\\n\\\\nStyleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, install Styleguidist:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save react-styleguidist\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add react-styleguidist\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen, add these scripts to your `package.json`:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n   \"scripts\": {\\\\n+    \"styleguide\": \"styleguidist server\",\\\\n+    \"styleguide:build\": \"styleguidist build\",\\\\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm run styleguide\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about React Styleguidist:\\\\n\\\\n* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)\\\\n* [Documentation](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/getting-started.html)\\\\n\\\\n## Making a Progressive Web App\\\\n\\\\nBy default, the production build is a fully functional, offline-first\\\\n[Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).\\\\n\\\\nProgressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:\\\\n\\\\n * All static site assets are cached so that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.\\\\n * Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the Subway.\\\\n * On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user\\\\\\'s home screen, app icon and all. You can also re-engage users using web **push notifications**. This eliminates the need for the app store.\\\\n\\\\nThe [`sw-precache-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin)\\\\nis integrated into production configuration,\\\\nand it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically\\\\nprecache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.\\\\nThe service worker will use a [cache-first strategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)\\\\nfor handling all requests for local assets, including the initial HTML, ensuring\\\\nthat your web app is reliably fast, even on a slow or unreliable network.\\\\n\\\\nIf you would prefer not to enable service workers prior to your initial\\\\nproduction deployment, then remove the call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()`\\\\nfrom [`src/index.js`](src/index.js).\\\\n\\\\nIf you had previously enabled service workers in your production deployment and\\\\nhave decided that you would like to disable them for all your existing users,\\\\nyou can swap out the call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()` in\\\\n[`src/index.js`](src/index.js) with a call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()`.\\\\nAfter the user visits a page that has `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()`,\\\\nthe service worker will be uninstalled.\\\\n\\\\n### Offline-First Considerations\\\\n\\\\n1. Service workers [require HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https),\\\\nalthough to facilitate local testing, that policy\\\\n[does not apply to `localhost`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385).\\\\nIf your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker\\\\nregistration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.\\\\n\\\\n1. Service workers are [not currently supported](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)\\\\nin all web browsers. Service worker registration [won\\\\\\'t be attempted](src/registerServiceWorker.js)\\\\non browsers that lack support.\\\\n\\\\n1. The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](#deployment),\\\\ne.g. the output of `npm run build`. It\\\\\\'s recommended that you do not enable an\\\\noffline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to\\\\nfrustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest\\\\nchanges you\\\\\\'ve made locally.\\\\n\\\\n1. If you *need* to test your offline-first service worker locally, build\\\\nthe application (using `npm run build`) and run a simple http server from your\\\\nbuild directory. After running the build script, `create-react-app` will give\\\\ninstructions for one way to test your production build locally and the [deployment instructions](#deployment) have\\\\ninstructions for using other methods. *Be sure to always use an\\\\nincognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache.*\\\\n\\\\n1. If possible, configure your production environment to serve the generated\\\\n`service-worker.js` [with HTTP caching disabled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38843970/service-worker-javascript-update-frequency-every-24-hours).\\\\nIf that\\\\\\'s not possible—[GitHub Pages](#github-pages), for instance, does not\\\\nallow you to change the default 10 minute HTTP cache lifetime—then be aware\\\\nthat if you visit your production site, and then revisit again before\\\\n`service-worker.js` has expired from your HTTP cache, you\\\\\\'ll continue to get\\\\nthe previously cached assets from the service worker. If you have an immediate\\\\nneed to view your updated production deployment, performing a shift-refresh\\\\nwill temporarily disable the service worker and retrieve all assets from the\\\\nnetwork.\\\\n\\\\n1. Users aren\\\\\\'t always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to\\\\n[let the user know](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption)\\\\nwhen the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a \"This web\\\\napp works offline!\" message) and also let them know when the service worker has\\\\nfetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the\\\\npage (showing a \"New content is available; please refresh.\" message). Showing\\\\nthis messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a\\\\nstarting point, you can make use of the logic included in [`src/registerServiceWorker.js`](src/registerServiceWorker.js), which\\\\ndemonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each\\\\nscenario, and which as a default, just logs appropriate messages to the\\\\nJavaScript console.\\\\n\\\\n1. By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any\\\\ncross-origin traffic, like HTTP [API requests](#integrating-with-an-api-backend),\\\\nimages, or embeds loaded from a different domain. If you would like to use a\\\\nruntime caching strategy for those requests, you can [`eject`](#npm-run-eject)\\\\nand then configure the\\\\n[`runtimeCaching`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#runtimecaching-arrayobject)\\\\noption in the `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` section of\\\\n[`webpack.config.prod.js`](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).\\\\n\\\\n### Progressive Web App Metadata\\\\n\\\\nThe default configuration includes a web app manifest located at\\\\n[`public/manifest.json`](public/manifest.json), that you can customize with\\\\ndetails specific to your web application.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on\\\\nAndroid, the metadata in [`manifest.json`](public/manifest.json) determines what\\\\nicons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.\\\\n[The Web App Manifest guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/)\\\\nprovides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations\\\\nwill affect your users\\\\\\' experience.\\\\n\\\\n## Analyzing the Bundle Size\\\\n\\\\n[Source map explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) analyzes\\\\nJavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code\\\\nbloat is coming from.\\\\n\\\\nTo add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save source-map-explorer\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add source-map-explorer\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen in `package.json`, add the following line to `scripts`:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n   \"scripts\": {\\\\n+    \"analyze\": \"source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.*\",\\\\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n     \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n     \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n>**Note:**\\\\n>\\\\n>This doesn\\\\\\'t quite work on Windows because it doesn\\\\\\'t automatically expand `*` in the filepath. For now, the workaround is to look at the full hashed filename in `build/static/js` (e.g. `main.89b7e95a.js`) and copy it into `package.json` when you\\\\\\'re running the analyzer. For example:\\\\n>\\\\n>```diff\\\\n>+    \"analyze\": \"source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.89b7e95a.js\",\\\\n>```\\\\n>\\\\n>Unfortunately it will be different after every build. You can express support for fixing this on Windows [in this issue](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer/issues/52).\\\\n\\\\nThen to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze\\\\nscript.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nnpm run build\\\\nnpm run analyze\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment\\\\n\\\\n`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.\\\\n\\\\n### Static Server\\\\n\\\\nFor environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install -g serve\\\\nserve -s build\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.\\\\n\\\\nRun this command to get a full list of the options available:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nserve -h\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Other Solutions\\\\n\\\\nYou don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/):\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconst express = require(\\\\\\'express\\\\\\');\\\\nconst path = require(\\\\\\'path\\\\\\');\\\\nconst app = express();\\\\n\\\\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \\\\\\'build\\\\\\')));\\\\n\\\\napp.get(\\\\\\'/\\\\\\', function (req, res) {\\\\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \\\\\\'build\\\\\\', \\\\\\'index.html\\\\\\'));\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\napp.listen(9000);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.\\\\n\\\\nThe `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.\\\\n\\\\nHowever this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.\\\\n\\\\n### Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing\\\\n\\\\nIf you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.\\\\n\\\\nThis is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \\\\\\'build\\\\\\')));\\\\n\\\\n-app.get(\\\\\\'/\\\\\\', function (req, res) {\\\\n+app.get(\\\\\\'/*\\\\\\', function (req, res) {\\\\n   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \\\\\\'build\\\\\\', \\\\\\'index.html\\\\\\'));\\\\n });\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), you need to create a `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder that looks like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n    Options -MultiViews\\\\n    RewriteEngine On\\\\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\\\\n    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt will get copied to the `build` folder when you run `npm run build`. \\\\n\\\\nIf you’re using [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), you need to follow [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41249464/4878474).\\\\n\\\\nNow requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production.\\\\n\\\\nOn a production build, and in a browser that supports [service workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers),\\\\nthe service worker will automatically handle all navigation requests, like for\\\\n`/todos/42`, by serving the cached copy of your `index.html`. This\\\\nservice worker navigation routing can be configured or disabled by\\\\n[`eject`ing](#npm-run-eject) and then modifying the\\\\n[`navigateFallback`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallback-string)\\\\nand [`navigateFallbackWhitelist`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallbackwhitelist-arrayregexp)\\\\noptions of the `SWPreachePlugin` [configuration](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).\\\\n\\\\n### Building for Relative Paths\\\\n\\\\nBy default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.<br>\\\\nTo override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n  \"homepage\": \"http://mywebsite.com/relativepath\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.\\\\n\\\\n#### Serving the Same Build from Different Paths\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are not using the HTML5 `pushState` history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your `package.json`:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n  \"homepage\": \".\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to `index.html`. You will then be able to move your app from `http://mywebsite.com` to `http://mywebsite.com/relativepath` or even `http://mywebsite.com/relative/path` without having to rebuild it.\\\\n\\\\n### Azure\\\\n\\\\nSee [this](https://medium.com/@to_pe/deploying-create-react-app-on-microsoft-azure-c0f6686a4321) blog post on how to deploy your React app to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).\\\\n\\\\n### Firebase\\\\n\\\\nInstall the Firebase CLI if you haven’t already by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`. Sign up for a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Run `firebase login` and login with your previous created Firebase account.\\\\n\\\\nThen run the `firebase init` command from your project’s root. You need to choose the **Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites** and choose the Firebase project you created in the previous step. You will need to agree with `database.rules.json` being created, choose `build` as the public directory, and also agree to **Configure as a single-page app** by replying with `y`.\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n    === Project Setup\\\\n\\\\n    First, let\\\\\\'s associate this project directory with a Firebase project.\\\\n    You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,\\\\n    but for now we\\\\\\'ll just set up a default project.\\\\n\\\\n    ? What Firebase project do you want to associate as default? Example app (example-app-fd690)\\\\n\\\\n    === Database Setup\\\\n\\\\n    Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be\\\\n    structured and when your data can be read from and written to.\\\\n\\\\n    ? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json\\\\n    ✔  Database Rules for example-app-fd690 have been downloaded to database.rules.json.\\\\n    Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run\\\\n    firebase deploy.\\\\n\\\\n    === Hosting Setup\\\\n\\\\n    Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that\\\\n    will contain Hosting assets to uploaded with firebase deploy. If you\\\\n    have a build process for your assets, use your build\\\\\\'s output directory.\\\\n\\\\n    ? What do you want to use as your public directory? build\\\\n    ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes\\\\n    ✔  Wrote build/index.html\\\\n\\\\n    i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...\\\\n    i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...\\\\n\\\\n    ✔  Firebase initialization complete!\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow, after you create a production build with `npm run build`, you can deploy it by running `firebase deploy`.\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n    === Deploying to \\\\\\'example-app-fd690\\\\\\'...\\\\n\\\\n    i  deploying database, hosting\\\\n    ✔  database: rules ready to deploy.\\\\n    i  hosting: preparing build directory for upload...\\\\n    Uploading: [==============================          ] 75%✔  hosting: build folder uploaded successfully\\\\n    ✔  hosting: 8 files uploaded successfully\\\\n    i  starting release process (may take several minutes)...\\\\n\\\\n    ✔  Deploy complete!\\\\n\\\\n    Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/example-app-fd690/overview\\\\n    Hosting URL: https://example-app-fd690.firebaseapp.com\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor more information see [Add Firebase to your JavaScript Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).\\\\n\\\\n### GitHub Pages\\\\n\\\\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 1: Add `homepage` to `package.json`\\\\n\\\\n**The step below is important!**<br>\\\\n**If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.**\\\\n\\\\nOpen your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\n  \"homepage\": \"https://myusername.github.io/my-app\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nCreate React App uses the `homepage` field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 2: Install `gh-pages` and add `deploy` to `scripts` in `package.json`\\\\n\\\\nNow, whenever you run `npm run build`, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.\\\\n\\\\nTo publish it at [https://myusername.github.io/my-app](https://myusername.github.io/my-app), run:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install --save gh-pages\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nyarn add gh-pages\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAdd the following scripts in your `package.json`:\\\\n\\\\n```diff\\\\n  \"scripts\": {\\\\n+   \"predeploy\": \"npm run build\",\\\\n+   \"deploy\": \"gh-pages -d build\",\\\\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\\\\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe `predeploy` script will run automatically before `deploy` is run.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 3: Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy`\\\\n\\\\nThen run:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm run deploy\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 4: Ensure your project’s settings use `gh-pages`\\\\n\\\\nFinally, make sure **GitHub Pages** option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:\\\\n\\\\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HUjEr9l.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"gh-pages branch setting\">\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 5: Optionally, configure the domain\\\\n\\\\nYou can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.\\\\n\\\\n#### Notes on client-side routing\\\\n\\\\nGitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\\\\n\\\\n* You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Router) about different history implementations in React Router.\\\\n* Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).\\\\n\\\\n### Heroku\\\\n\\\\nUse the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).<br>\\\\nYou can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).\\\\n\\\\n#### Resolving Heroku Deployment Errors\\\\n\\\\nSometimes `npm run build` works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.\\\\n\\\\n##### \"Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \\\\\\'file\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'directory\\\\\\'\"\\\\n\\\\nIf you get something like this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nremote: Failed to create a production build. Reason:\\\\nremote: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \\\\\\'file\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'directory\\\\\\'\\\\nMyDirectory in /tmp/build_1234/src\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you `import` matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.\\\\n\\\\nThis is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So `MyDirectory` and `mydirectory` are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the `import` statements on Heroku remotes.\\\\n\\\\n##### \"Could not find a required file.\"\\\\n\\\\nIf you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nremote: Could not find a required file.\\\\nremote:   Name: `index.html`\\\\nremote:   Searched in: /tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/public\\\\nremote:\\\\nremote: npm ERR! Linux 3.13.0-105-generic\\\\nremote: npm ERR! argv \"/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/node\" \"/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/npm\" \"run\" \"build\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this case, ensure that the file is there with the proper lettercase and that’s not ignored on your local `.gitignore` or `~/.gitignore_global`.\\\\n\\\\n### Modulus\\\\n\\\\nSee the [Modulus blog post](http://blog.modulus.io/deploying-react-apps-on-modulus) on how to deploy your react app to Modulus.\\\\n\\\\n### Netlify\\\\n\\\\n**To do a manual deploy to Netlify’s CDN:**\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\nnpm install netlify-cli\\\\nnetlify deploy\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nChoose `build` as the path to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n**To setup continuous delivery:**\\\\n\\\\nWith this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:\\\\n\\\\n1. [Start a new netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup)\\\\n2. Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository\\\\n3. Click `Build your site`\\\\n\\\\n**Support for client-side routing:**\\\\n\\\\nTo support `pushState`, make sure to create a `public/_redirects` file with the following rewrite rules:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n/*  /index.html  200\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen you build the project, Create React App will place the `public` folder contents into the build output.\\\\n\\\\n### Now\\\\n\\\\n[now](https://zeit.co/now) offers a zero-configuration single-command deployment. You can use `now` to deploy your app for free.\\\\n\\\\n1. Install the `now` command-line tool either via the recommended [desktop tool](https://zeit.co/download) or via node with `npm install -g now`.\\\\n\\\\n2. Build your app by running `npm run build`.\\\\n\\\\n3. Move into the build directory by running `cd build`.\\\\n\\\\n4. Run `now --name your-project-name` from within the build directory. You will see a **now.sh** URL in your output like this:\\\\n\\\\n    ```\\\\n    > Ready! https://your-project-name-tpspyhtdtk.now.sh (copied to clipboard)\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app.\\\\n\\\\nDetails are available in [this article.](https://zeit.co/blog/unlimited-static)\\\\n\\\\n### S3 and CloudFront\\\\n\\\\nSee this [blog post](https://medium.com/@omgwtfmarc/deploying-create-react-app-to-s3-or-cloudfront-48dae4ce0af) on how to deploy your React app to Amazon Web Services [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).\\\\n\\\\n### Surge\\\\n\\\\nInstall the Surge CLI if you haven’t already by running `npm install -g surge`. Run the `surge` command and log in you or create a new account.\\\\n\\\\nWhen asked about the project path, make sure to specify the `build` folder, for example:\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n       project path: /path/to/project/build\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNote that in order to support routers that use HTML5 `pushState` API, you may want to rename the `index.html` in your build folder to `200.html` before deploying to Surge. This [ensures that every URL falls back to that file](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing).\\\\n\\\\n## Advanced Configuration\\\\n\\\\nYou can adjust various development and production settings by setting environment variables in your shell or with [.env](#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env).\\\\n\\\\nVariable | Development | Production | Usage\\\\n:--- | :---: | :---: | :---\\\\nBROWSER | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a [browser](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn#app) to override this behavior, or set it to `none` to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to `npm start` will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script\\\\\\'s file name must have the `.js` extension.\\\\nHOST | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, the development web server binds to `localhost`. You may use this variable to specify a different host.\\\\nPORT | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, the development web server will attempt to listen on port 3000 or prompt you to attempt the next available port. You may use this variable to specify a different port.\\\\nHTTPS | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When set to `true`, Create React App will run the development server in `https` mode.\\\\nPUBLIC_URL | :x: | :white_check_mark: | Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server\\\\\\'s root or a subpath as specified in [`package.json` (`homepage`)](#building-for-relative-paths). Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.\\\\nCI | :large_orange_diamond: | :white_check_mark: | When set to `true`, Create React App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching. Most CIs set this flag by default.\\\\nREACT_EDITOR | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace. When you click on it, Create React App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file. You can [send a pull request to detect your editor of choice](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2636). Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection. If you do it, make sure your systems [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable points to your editor’s bin folder.\\\\n\\\\n## Troubleshooting\\\\n\\\\n### `npm start` doesn’t detect changes\\\\n\\\\nWhen you save a file while `npm start` is running, the browser should refresh with the updated code.<br>\\\\nIf this doesn’t happen, try one of the following workarounds:\\\\n\\\\n* If your project is in a Dropbox folder, try moving it out.\\\\n* If the watcher doesn’t see a file called `index.js` and you’re referencing it by the folder name, you [need to restart the watcher](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1164) due to a Webpack bug.\\\\n* Some editors like Vim and IntelliJ have a “safe write” feature that currently breaks the watcher. You will need to disable it. Follow the instructions in [“Adjusting Your Text Editor”](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor).\\\\n* If your project path contains parentheses, try moving the project to a path without them. This is caused by a [Webpack watcher bug](https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/issues/42).\\\\n* On Linux and macOS, you might need to [tweak system settings](https://webpack.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#not-enough-watchers) to allow more watchers.\\\\n* If the project runs inside a virtual machine such as (a Vagrant provisioned) VirtualBox, create an `.env` file in your project directory if it doesn’t exist, and add `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` to it. This ensures that the next time you run `npm start`, the watcher uses the polling mode, as necessary inside a VM.\\\\n\\\\nIf none of these solutions help please leave a comment [in this thread](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/659).\\\\n\\\\n### `npm test` hangs on macOS Sierra\\\\n\\\\nIf you run `npm test` and the console gets stuck after printing `react-scripts test --env=jsdom` to the console there might be a problem with your [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) installation as described in [facebookincubator/create-react-app#713](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/713).\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend deleting `node_modules` in your project and running `npm install` (or `yarn` if you use it) first. If it doesn\\\\\\'t help, you can try one of the numerous workarounds mentioned in these issues:\\\\n\\\\n* [facebook/jest#1767](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767)\\\\n* [facebook/watchman#358](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/358)\\\\n* [ember-cli/ember-cli#6259](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6259)\\\\n\\\\nIt is reported that installing Watchman 4.7.0 or newer fixes the issue. If you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can run these commands to update it:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nwatchman shutdown-server\\\\nbrew update\\\\nbrew reinstall watchman\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can find [other installation methods](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install) on the Watchman documentation page.\\\\n\\\\nIf this still doesn’t help, try running `launchctl unload -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist`.\\\\n\\\\nThere are also reports that *uninstalling* Watchman fixes the issue. So if nothing else helps, remove it from your system and try again.\\\\n\\\\n### `npm run build` exits too early\\\\n\\\\nIt is reported that `npm run build` can fail on machines with limited memory and no swap space, which is common in cloud environments. Even with small projects this command can increase RAM usage in your system by hundreds of megabytes, so if you have less than 1 GB of available memory your build is likely to fail with the following message:\\\\n\\\\n>  The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are completely sure that you didn\\\\\\'t terminate the process, consider [adding some swap space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04) to the machine you’re building on, or build the project locally.\\\\n\\\\n### `npm run build` fails on Heroku\\\\n\\\\nThis may be a problem with case sensitive filenames.\\\\nPlease refer to [this section](#resolving-heroku-deployment-errors).\\\\n\\\\n### Moment.js locales are missing\\\\n\\\\nIf you use a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), you might notice that only the English locale is available by default. This is because the locale files are large, and you probably only need a subset of [all the locales provided by Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/#multiple-locale-support).\\\\n\\\\nTo add a specific Moment.js locale to your bundle, you need to import it explicitly.<br>\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport moment from \\\\\\'moment\\\\\\';\\\\nimport \\\\\\'moment/locale/fr\\\\\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf import multiple locales this way, you can later switch between them by calling `moment.locale()` with the locale name:\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport moment from \\\\\\'moment\\\\\\';\\\\nimport \\\\\\'moment/locale/fr\\\\\\';\\\\nimport \\\\\\'moment/locale/es\\\\\\';\\\\n\\\\n// ...\\\\n\\\\nmoment.locale(\\\\\\'fr\\\\\\');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will only work for locales that have been explicitly imported before.\\\\n\\\\n## Something Missing?\\\\n\\\\nIf you have ideas for more “How To” recipes that should be on this page, [let us know](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues) or [contribute some!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/edit/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'jonas-lundqvist/vlc-spotify\\', \\'language\\': \\'C\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'Status\\\\n======\\\\nThe development of this project has been put on hold due to show stopping issues with libspotify that I don\\\\\\'t have the energy to try to work around.\\\\nI wrote a rant about it in a [blog post](https://jonaslundqvist.net/2015/05/06/do-not-use-libspotify/) with a follow-up [here](https://jonaslundqvist.net/2015/05/07/do-use-libspotify-later-this-year/).\\\\n\\\\nAs Spotify says they plan to release a new library sometime later this year and then I might resume development.\\\\n\\\\nIf someone still would like some feature or such please go ahead and create an issue and/or pull request here on GitHub and I\\\\\\'ll see what I can do.\\\\n\\\\nAbout\\\\n=====\\\\nThis plugin adds support for playing spotify tracks in VLC media player.\\\\nThe code should be seen as a prototype and I can\\\\\\'t claim that it is \"work in progress\" since I don\\\\\\'t really know if I will further develop it into something useful.

It is intended for use on Ubuntu systems - current dependency is notify-osd.\\\\n\\\\n![Example image](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100344/spotifynotify2.png)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGetting started\\\\n---------------\\\\n### Installation\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to install spotify-notify permanently, it\\\\\\'s recommended to follow these instructions. They apply to Ubuntu only but may work on other Debian-based distros as well.\\\\n\\\\nJust execute the following terminal commands to install spotify-notify:\\\\n```bash\\\\nsudo mkdir /opt/spotify-notify/     # Create new directory to install spotify-notify\\\\ncd /opt/spotify-notify/             # Change current directory to this folder\\\\n# Download current version of spotify-notify\\\\nsudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sveint/spotify-notify/master/spotify-notify.py\\\\nsudo chmod a+x spotify-notify.py    # Mark spotify-notify.py as an executable\\\\npython spotify-notify.py -s &       # Start spotify-notify in background\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Adding spotify-notify to autostart\\\\nIn Ubuntu you can easily add spotify-notify to the autostart. You only need to open the startup-programmes dialog. More details can be found in the [Ubuntu Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup#Startup_Programs). As the name you can choose something like \"Spotify Notify\" and as the command to be executed, choose\\\\n\\\\n`python spotify-notify.py -s`\\\\n\\\\nThe comment field can be left empty.\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced\\\\n--------\\\\n### Running spotify-notify (general information)\\\\nTo get it running, you first need to clone this repository or download the file `spotify-notify.py`. Afterwards you can run spotify-notify by\\\\n\\\\n`python spotify-notify.py`\\\\n\\\\nIt will launch Spotify for you if not already running. Please see options below to change default behavior.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to launch the file directly you can first add execution rights to it:\\\\n\\\\n`chmod a+x spotify-notify.py`\\\\n\\\\nthen launch by\\\\n\\\\n`./spotify-notify.py`\\\\n\\\\n### Command line options\\\\n\\\\nAvailable options are:\\\\n\\\\n| Option                        | Description                                                |\\\\n| ------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------:|\\\\n| `-h, --help`                  | Show help message and exit                                 |\\\\n| `-a ACTION, --action=ACTION`  | Music player actions (playPause/play/pause/next/previous). |\\\\n| `-n, --skip_notify`           | Song change notifications will be turned off.              |\\\\n| `-m, --skip_media_keys`       | Multimedia keys will not interact with spotify.            |\\\\n| `-s, --skip_spotify`          | Spotify will not be opened if it is not running and spotify notify will not close when spotify is closed. |\\\\n| `-d, --debug`                 | Debug messages will be displayed.                          |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### FAQ\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Q: How can I launch the script at startup?\\\\n\\\\nJust add a new entry to the startup applications, using the following as the \"Command\"-string;\\\\n\\\\n`/<path>/<to>/spotify-notify/spotify-notify.py -s`\\\\n\\\\n- Make sure that \"spotify-notify.py\" is executable\\\\n- Make note of the \"-s\" parameter at the end, as this makes sure that spotify-notify doesn\\\\\\'t start Spotify, and that it doesn\\\\\\'t quit when you quit Spotify.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Q: I want to use the script just for the media key support.

You\\\\\\'ll be using Spotify\\\\\\'s search endpoint to search for tracks (songs).\\\\n\\\\n## Minimum Requirements\\\\n\\\\n1. Your app must have a form to search for tracks (songs). The form needs an input field for the search keyword.\\\\n2. When a user submits the form, use jQuery to get the search keyword from the form input.\\\\n3. Use AJAX to call Spotify\\\\\\'s search endpoint with the search keyword from the form.\\\\n4. On success of the AJAX call, render the search results on the page. You should include at least the track name and artist name.\\\\n5. Each time the user submits the form, clear the previous search results from the view.\\\\n\\\\n## Bonus\\\\n\\\\n1. Display a track\\\\\\'s album artwork next to each search result in the view. **Hint:** You\\\\\\'ll notice if you try to access the album artwork but none is available, your app will break. Prevent this from happening with a check to see if any artwork is available first.\\\\n2. Spotify gives us a `preview_url` for each track. Create a play button for each track in your view that opens the `preview_url` in a new tab (it will start playing the song!).\\\\n3. It would be nice to let the user know something is happening in the few milliseconds between submitting the form and getting data on the page. Show `loading.gif` when the form submits, and hide it when you get data back from Spotify.\\\\n4. Handle the case where no data comes back from Spotify. You\\\\\\'ll want to let the user know that there are no results, rather than just showing a blank page.\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started\\\\n\\\\n1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.\\\\n2. Practice querying Spotify\\\\\\'s search endpoint using Postman with a couple different search keywords. You\\\\\\'ll want to set `type=track` in your request URL. Look at the response data, and figure out how you would access the track name and artist name for a particular track (this will involve accessing values from nested objects and arrays).\\\\n3. Once you feel comfortable with the structure of the response data, work on using AJAX to make the API call to Spotify when the user submits the form.\\\\n4. Start by `console.log`-ing the response data. Once you have that working, access the data you need (track name and artist name), and use jQuery to `append` it to the page. **Hint:** You\\\\\\'ll need to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\" target=\"_blank\">Array#forEach</a> to iterate through all the tracks Spotify returns in the response data.\\\\n\\\\n## Submission\\\\n\\\\n* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.\\\\n* Once you\\\\\\'ve finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.\\\\n\\\\n## Resources\\\\n\\\\n* <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery.get()</a>\\\\n* <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Search Endpoint</a>\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'masroorhasan/spotifycli\\', \\'language\\': \\'Go\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotifycli\\\\n\\\\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/masroorhasan/spotifycli/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/masroorhasan/spotifycli/tree/master)\\\\n\\\\nA command line interface to manage Spotify playlists.\\\\n\\\\n## Install\\\\n\\\\nTo use `spotifycli` you have to register the application on Spotify\\\\\\'s developer platform.

This only needs to be done once (per user).*</sup>\\\\n\\\\n## Required packages\\\\n\\\\nTo use SpotifyRandomizer, you need [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy).\\\\nYou can install it using `pip`: `pip3 install spotipy`\\\\n\\\\n## Setup\\\\n\\\\n1. Create a spotify application so you can use `spotipy`. You can do this at the [Spotify developer website](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/).\\\\n2. Now you need to give the program your client ID & client secret. You can do this in 2 ways:\\\\n    1. Uncomment the lines in `randomizer.py` _(by removing the # in the beginning of the line)_ that set these variables and inputting yours.\\\\n       ```python\\\\n       os.environ[\"SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID\"] = \"myclientid\"\\\\n       os.environ[\"SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET\"] = \"myclientsecret\"\\\\n       ```\\\\n    2. Export those variables using your terminal. On windows:\\\\n    \\\\n       ```cmd\\\\n       SET SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=myclientid\\\\n       SET SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=myclientsecret\\\\n       ```\\\\n    \\\\n        On linux:\\\\n        ```bash\\\\n        export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=myclientid\\\\n        export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=myclientsecret\\\\n        ```\\\\n        \\\\n        You only need to do this once.\\\\n    \\\\n    The default redirect URL is `http://localhost:14523` for the local webserver.\\\\n3. Optionally, you can give the program the Spotify username and the playlists to shuffle. You can do this in 2 ways:\\\\n    1. Uncomment the lines in `randomizer.py` _(by removing the # in the beginning of the line)_ that set these variables and inputting yours.\\\\n       ```python\\\\n       os.environ[\"USER\"] = \"myusername\"\\\\n       os.environ[\"PLAYLISTS\"] = \"Playlist1,Playlist2,Playlist3\"\\\\n       ```\\\\n    2. Export those variables using your terminal. On windows:\\\\n\\\\n       ```cmd\\\\n       SET USER=myusername\\\\n       SET PLAYLISTS=Playlist1,Playlist2,Playlist3\\\\n       ```\\\\n\\\\n        On linux:\\\\n        ```bash\\\\n        export USER=myusername\\\\n        export PLAYLISTS=Playlist1,Playlist2,Playlist3\\\\n        ```\\\\n\\\\n        You only need to do this once.\\\\n4. You\\\\\\'re done - you can basically change anything else you\\\\\\'d like.\\\\n\\\\n## Run\\\\n\\\\nThe script can be ran by doing `python3 main.py`.\\\\nIn this case the program will ask you for your username and playlist(s) while running.\\\\nYou can also give that information as an argument, like this `python3 main.py 1234567890 Playlist1 Playlist2 Playlist3`\\\\n\\\\nThe playlists can be the name of the playlist or the ID of the playlist (found in the URL). These playlists have to be owned by you.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you run the program for the first time, it will open the spotify website for authorization. Then you need to copy the redirected URL into the commandline. After this, the program should work.\\\\n\\\\n### Other\\\\n\\\\nAlso check out [the repo SpotifyNoDupes](https://github.com/stavlocker/spotifynodupes) if you want to get rid of your duplicate songs in playlists.\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'charlypoly/spotify-api-graphql-console\\', \\'language\\': \\'TypeScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'# Spotify GraphQL Console\\\\n\\\\n*Built on top of [spotify-graphql](https://github.com/thefrenchhouse/spotify-graphql)*\\\\n\\\\n[![https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/github-oss/spotify-api-graphql-console/demo](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/github-oss/spotify-api-graphql-console/demo)](https://spotify-api-graphql-console.herokuapp.com/)\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'spotify/jsconfeu-2013\\', \\'language\\': \\'JavaScript\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"Overview\\\\n========\\\\n\\\\n![Spotify Logo](/resources/spotify-logo.png)\\\\n\\\\nSpotify Coding challenge for [jsconfeu-2013](http://2013.jsconf.eu/)\\\\n\\\\n* You need to solve at least one challenge in order to win a Spotify prize.

There is\\\\nalso a program that retreives the title and artist of the currently playing\\\\nsong on spotify.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\nDBus is used for listening to spotify track changes. Obviously you need spotify\\\\nand polybar as well:\\\\n`dbus polybar spotify`\\\\n\\\\nTo compile the program, you will need `make`.\\\\n\\\\nYou most likely already have the above packages installed. Systemd depends on\\\\nDBus, and you wouldn\\\\\\'t be looking at this, if you didn\\\\\\'t have polybar and\\\\nspotify installed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## How to Setup\\\\n\\\\n### Installing the Program\\\\nRun the following code to clone the repo and install the programs.\\\\n```\\\\ngit clone https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-spotify-module\\\\ncd polybar-spotify-module/src/\\\\nsudo make install\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Arch Linux Users\\\\n`polybar-spotify-module` exists as a package on the AUR! Use your favourite\\\\nAUR helper to install the package.\\\\n```\\\\nyay -S polybar-spotify-module\\\\n```\\\\nThe package can be found here\\\\n<https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/polybar-spotify-module/>.\\\\n\\\\n### Running spotify-listener in the Background\\\\n`spotify-listener` must run in the background for it to be able to listen for\\\\ntrack changes and communicate with polybar. There are two ways to keep it\\\\nrunning in the background. If you are using systemd, you can have it start at\\\\nsystem startup by running:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsystemctl --user enable spotify-listener\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen, you can start the service now by running:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsystemctl --user start spotify-listener\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you are not using systemd, make sure the `spotify-listener` program is\\\\nexecuted at startup. Something like\\\\n```\\\\nspotify-listener &\\\\ndisown\\\\n```\\\\nin a startup script should accomplish that.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Configuring Polybar\\\\nYour polybar configuration file should be located at `.config/polybar/config`\\\\n\\\\nFirst make sure IPC is enabled. The following should be in your configuration\\\\nfile under the `[bar/<your bar name>]` section:\\\\n```\\\\n[bar/main]\\\\nenable-ipc = true\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you plan to use icons for next/play/previous/pause buttons, make sure you\\\\nadd (and have installed) an icon font accordingly such as NerdFonts or\\\\nFontAwesome under the `[bar/<your bar name>]` section:\\\\n```\\\\n[bar/main]\\\\nfont-1 = Font Awesome 5 Free:size=10;1\\\\n```\\\\nNote that the font is specified in modules as a 1-based index, so `font-1` is\\\\nspecified by `format-font = 2`.\\\\n\\\\nNext, add the following spotify modules:\\\\n```\\\\n[module/previous]\\\\ntype = custom/ipc\\\\nformat-font = 2\\\\n; Default\\\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\\\n; When spotify active\\\\nhook-1 = echo \"Previous\"\\\\nclick-left = \"spotifyctl -q previous\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[module/next]\\\\ntype = custom/ipc\\\\nformat-font = 2\\\\n; Default\\\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\\\n; When spotify active\\\\nhook-1 = echo \"Next\"\\\\nclick-left = \"spotifyctl -q next\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[module/playpause]\\\\ntype = custom/ipc\\\\nformat-font = 2\\\\n; Default\\\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\\\n; Playing\\\\nhook-1 = echo \"Pause\"\\\\n; Paused\\\\nhook-2 = echo \"Play\"\\\\nclick-left = \"spotifyctl -q playpause\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[module/spotify]\\\\ntype = custom/ipc\\\\n; Default\\\\nhook-0 = echo \"\"\\\\n; Playing/paused show song name and artist\\\\nhook-1 = spotifyctl -q status --format \\\\\\'%artist%: %title%\\\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\nYou can replace the text for Pause/Play/Next/Previous with icons for each of\\\\nthe hooks.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, make sure the new spotify modules are part of your bar. Make sure one of\\\\nthe following lines is part of your modules.\\\\n```\\\\nmodules-center = spotify previous playpause next\\\\nmodules-left = spotify previous playpause next\\\\nmodules-right = spotify previous playpause next\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Status Formatting\\\\nThe `spotifyctl status` command has multiple formatting options. You can\\\\nspecify the:\\\\n- Maximum output length\\\\n- Maximum artist length\\\\n- Maxiumum track title length\\\\n- Output Format\\\\n- Truncation string\\\\n\\\\nBy default, the above lengths are `INT_MAX` (no limit). Additionally, if max\\\\nlength is specified, the artist and track title will not be truncated if\\\\nthe untruncated output satisfies the output max length constraint.\\\\n\\\\nThe tokens `%artist%` and `%title%` can be used to specify the output format.\\\\n\\\\nFor example for the artist `Eminem` and track title `Sing For The Moment`\\\\n```\\\\nspotifyctl status --format \\\\\\'%artist%: %title%\\\\\\' --max-length 20 \\\\\\\\\\\\n    --max-title-length 10 --max-artist-length 10 --trunc \\\\\\'...\\\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\nwould result in the following output\\\\n```\\\\nEminem: Sing Fo...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor more information and examples, you can run the command `spotifyctl help`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## How it Works\\\\nThe spotify-listener program connects to the DBus Session Bus and listens for\\\\ntwo particular signals:\\\\n\\\\n- `org.freedesktop.DBus.ProprtyChanged` for track changes\\\\n- `org.freedesktop.DBus.NameOwnerChanged` for spotify disconnections\\\\n\\\\nUsing this information, it sends messages to spotify polybar custom/IPC modules\\\\nto show/hide spotify controls and display the play/pause icon based on whether\\\\na song is playing/paused.\\\\n\\\\nThe spotifyctl program calls `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Properties.Get` method to\\\\nretreive status information and calls methods in the\\\\n`org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player` interface to pause/play and go to the\\\\nprevious/next track.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Why Did I Make this in C\\\\n- Practice/learn low-level C\\\\n- Reduce number of dependencies\\\\n- Make something as lightweight as possible by directly interfacing with DBus\\\\n- For fun 😜\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Resources\\\\nThe following are very useful resources for DBus API and specs:\\\\n\\\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusConnection.html>\\\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusBus.html>\\\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusMessage.html>\\\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html>\\\\n- <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Credits\\\\nInspired by the python implementation by\\\\n[dietervanhoof](https://github.com/dietervanhoof): <https://github.com/dietervanhoof/polybar-spotify-controls>\\\\n\\'} {\\'repo\\': \\'remvee/spotify-el\\', \\'language\\': \\'Emacs Lisp\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \"spotify.el -- Control the spotify application from emacs\\\\n\\\\nPlay, pause, skip songs in the Spotify app from Emacs.\\\\n\\\\nCopyright (C) 2012, 2013 R.W van \\'t Veer\\\\nCopyright (C) 2013 Bjarte Johansen\\\\n\\\\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\\\\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\\\\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3\\\\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\\\\n\\\\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\\\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\\\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Otherwise, it works exactly the same as [Backbone\\'s router](http://backbonejs.org/#Router).\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n    var Router = BackboneSpotify.Router.extend({\\\\n        routes: {\\\\n            \\'index\\': \\'index\\',\\\\n            \\'person:<name>\\': \\'profile\\',\\\\n        },\\\\n\\\\n        index: function() {\\\\n            // ...\\\\n        },\\\\n\\\\n        profile: function(name) {\\\\n            // ...\\\\n        }\\\\n    });\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n``BackboneSpotify.History``\\\\n---------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThis is a completely rewritten version of Backbone\\'s history designed to work with Spotify\\'s URIs and ``ARGUMENTSCHANGED`` event. It needs to be passed a Spotify application object which has the `arguments` and `uri` properties loaded. You can then use it in the same way as Backbone\\'s history:\\\\n    \\\\n    require(\\'$api/models\\', function(models) {\\\\n      models.application.load([\\'arguments\\', \\'uri\\']).done(function(application) {\\\\n        Backbone.history = new BackboneSpotify.History({application: application});\\\\n        var router = new Router();\\\\n        Backbone.history.start();\\\\n      });\\\\n    });\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s a bit smarter than the normal Backbone history, though. It keeps a stack of visited pages, similar to how a normal browser does. When you navigate to a new page, a reference to the view on the previous page is kept so it can be restored when you press the back button. (The example app shows you how to to restore scroll position with this.)\\\\n\\\\nSpotify doesn\\'t actually tell us whether the user used the back or forward button, but we can guess. If the URI is changed to something which is one position down in the stack, we assume they clicked the back button. One position up, and they probably hit the next button.\\\\n\\\\nTo activate the history stack, you need to set a ``view`` property on your router which is a reference to the view for the current page. When you navigate to new page, this reference is stored in the stack.\\\\n\\\\n### Freezing and restoring views\\\\n\\\\nWhen a view is stored in the stack, a ``freeze`` method is called on the router and the view. (The router gets passed the view as an argument too.)\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, when a view is restored by hitting the back or forward button, a ``restore`` method is called on the router and the view. \\\\n\\\\nSee the example app for how you can use these methods. Note that they get called **after** the URI is routed.\\\\n\\\\n### Example\\\\n\\\\nThis is a basic example of a router that uses the history stack:\\\\n\\\\n    var Router = BackboneSpotify.Router.extend({\\\\n        routes: {\\\\n            \\'index\\': \\'index\\',\\\\n            \\'other\\': \\'other\\',\\\\n        },\\\\n\\\\n        index: function() {\\\\n            this.restore(new IndexView());\\\\n            this.view.render();\\\\n        },\\\\n\\\\n        other: function() {\\\\n            this.restore(new OtherView());\\\\n            this.view.render();\\\\n        },\\\\n\\\\n        restore: function(view) {\\\\n            this.view = view;\\\\n            $(\\'.content\\').html(this.view.$el);\\\\n        },\\\\n    });\\\\n\\\\nTest suite\\\\n----------\\\\n\\\\nOpen up `test/index.html` in a browser.\\\\n\\\\nChange log\\\\n----------\\\\n\\\\n### 1.1.0\\\\n\\\\n - Support for [Spotify apps API 1.0.0](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/upgrade-guide/1.0.0).\\\\n\\\\n### 1.0.0\\\\n\\\\n - Initial release.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nContributors\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\n - [Ben Firshman](https://github.com/bfirsh)\\\\n - [Andreas Jansson](https://github.com/andreasjansson)\\\\n - [Tom Jakubowski](https://github.com/tomjakubowski)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"} {\\'repo\\': \\'importerror/pms\\', \\'language\\': \\'Python\\', \\'readme_contents\\': \\'pms\\\\n===\\\\n\\\\n - Search and stream music\\\\n - Download music\\\\n - Works with Python 2.7 and 3\\\\n - Works with Windows and Linux (untested with MacOS)\\\\n - No Python dependencies\\\\n - Requires mplayer\\\\n\\\\n# Installation:\\\\n\\\\nUsing pip:\\\\n    \\\\n    sudo pip install Poor-Mans-Spotify\\\\n    \\\\nUsing git:\\\\n\\\\n    git clone https://github.com/np1/pms.git\\\\n\\\\nManually:\\\\n\\\\nDownload [zip](https://github.com/np1/pms/archive/master.zip)/[tar.gz](https://github.com/np1/pms/archive/master.tar.gz) file and extract\\\\n\\\\n# Usage\\\\n\\\\n    usage: pms.py query [query ...]\\\\n\\\\n    or simply:\\\\n\\\\n    pms.py\\\\n\\\\n# Screenshot\\\\n![pms running in terminal](http://i.imgur.com/Oqyz5vk.png \"pms running in terminal\")\\\\n\\\\n# Usage Example:\\\\n\\\\n    $ > ls\\\\n    LICENSE  pms.py  README.md\\\\n    $ > ./pms.py\\\\n    Enter artist/song to search : gotye somebody i used to know\\\\n\\\\n    Search for \\\\\\'gotye somebody i used to know\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\n    Item   Size    Artist                Track                  Length   Bitrate \\\\n    ----   ----    ------                -----                  ------   ------- \\\\n    1      3.7 Mb  Gotye feat.
